**Primer:**

The backstory behind this page is [here](/2017/09/30/codex-vitae/). This is modeled on [Buster Benson's](https://twitter.com/buster) [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public). In addition, I've [read](https://betterhumans.coach.me/codex-vitae-635f97552092) [several](https://github.com/itamargo/codex/blob/master/Codex.md) [other](https://pistevo.com/2017/01/codex-vitae-book-of-life) [ones](https://github.com/dehowell/codex-vitae) [that I](https://www.gitbook.com/book/pandagirl/codex-vitae/details) [found online](https://github.com/rd825/codexvitae/blob/master/codex2017v1.md) and the resulting document is a mix of my own thoughts as well as ones borrowed from others. Thanks to everyone out there that helped (both explicitly and implicitly).

**If you are Chris:**

* Use the Codex as a repository for your beliefs & values. 
* Do a monthly or quarterly review of whether my life is in alignment. If not, shoudld my behavior change or should my values change?
* Do a annual review of the entire document. Expect beliefs and tactics to change -- don't hold on to them too rigidly.  
</br>

**If you are not Chris:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.

**General**

Meta-beliefs  
*Beliefs about beliefs*  

* Our beliefs are based on our past experiences.  
* Our beliefs shape & drive all of our decisions.  
* Explicitly stating and examining our beliefs lead us away from bias and closer to truth.  
* Our beliefs should constantly be challenged and evolve with time.  
* Our historical beliefs will not always work for tomorrow.  
</br>

**Selfcare**

Productivity

* Have a system.   
* Your system should evolve with your work.
* Your system should make your more productive, not less.
* Real work > work work.
* Work on things that allow you to spend the most time in a flow state.    
* Prioritize the most important work of the day.  
* Plan out your day the evening before.  
* Manage your energy. There’s always more work.
* Parkinson’s law is real.    
</br>

Food

* Most foods that we consume are garbage.  
* Diets don’t work.  
* Food is more than just for physical nutrition.  
* Food brings people together.  
* Food is an important part of culture.  
* As with everything else, don’t indulge. Moderation.  
* Small, frequent meals.  
* Cheating sometimes is ok.  
</br>

Physical Fitness

* Working out is good for your body and your mind.  
* Also good for discipline & structure.  
* Physical fitness is important to living a healthy life.  
* Fluctuations are ok.  
</br>

Intoxicants (Drugs, Alcohol, etc.)  

* Drugs can be useful in the right context.  
* Over indulgence in drugs (as with anything) is bad.  
* Alcohol can be a crutch to escape or avoid. Use it carefully.  
* If you can’t control yourself, don’t be around it.  
</br>

Mental and Emotional Wellness

* Mental & emotional wellness takes work.  
* It requires alone time.  
* It requires reflection & planning.  
* Having good mental & emotional wellness is a decision.   
* Going through ups and downs are fine and normal.  
* Understanding who I am is the key to wellness.   
* Wellness leads to being comfortable with who you are & confidence.  
</br>

Relationships

* Relationships are important for a happy life.  
* Relationships aren't free, they require active maintenance.  
* Depth of relationship is shared mind states, not connections.  
* Diversity in relationships are important.  
* People change, your dynamic with them will also have to change.  
* You don’t have to be liked by everyone.  
* You don’t have to like / agree with someone to love them.  
* Family relationships are hard to maintain. Over time you switch from being taken care of, to taking of. The transitions are hard to deal with.  
</br>

**Material World**

Money

* The pursuit of money is futile and never-ending.  
* Money doesn’t make you happy. 
* But not having enough is bad and all consuming.    
* Money is fuel. You need it, but you're not touring gas stations.  
* Money should be invested.  
* Spend on experiences over physical goods.  
* Save.  
</br>

Personal Appearance

* Presentation is important.  
* First appearances / impressions matter.  
* People prefer thin and good looking over fat & ugly.  
* How people dress are usually not a reflection of who they really are.    
* Clothes can make you more confident, even if it shouldn’t.  
</br>

**Work**

Career

* Your career is important, but not as important as your life.  
* Nobody will hand you a career path. It's your own responsibility. 
* Every step in your career should be optimized for learning.  
* Your network is the most important thing to build & acquire.  
* Diversity in experiences is a competitive advantage.     
* Luck is just as important as skill. You can’t prep, so just be prepared.  
* There will be twists & turns. Enjoy the journey.  
* Work is more than money. It should have meaning.    
* Work is ultimately about people. You have to love who you work with.  
* No job or company is perfect. Don't run away, make it better.  
* Teaching is often a great way to learn.  
* Don’t be too quick to judge others. Everyone is fighting their own fight.  
</br>

Business

* Businesses are built on top of solutions to valuable problems.  
* Businesses should not be optimized for cash, but for value.    
* No business lasts forever.  
* Not everyone business needs to be a billion dollar business.  
* People are the core — shitty people, shitty business.  
* Public markets are bad.  
* Private markets are possibly worse.  
* You can do good and make money at the same time.  
* Business that make no money are not businesses.  
* Businesses that don’t reinvent themselves are destined to fail.  
</br>

Learning

* Learning & the process of mastery is happiness.  
* Find out what medium is best for you and learn that way.   
* Stories are a great way to learn.  
* Learn and collect mental models.  
* Use these mental models to think through problems.  
* Learning comes in many forms.  
* There is a lesson in everything.  
* If you’re not learning, you’re dead.  
</br>

Passion Projects

* Everyone should have at least one.  
* Not every passion project needs to make money.  
</br>

**Philosophy**

Society

* Modern society is highly imperfect.  
* We are not prepared for the information age.  
* Most rules & laws are outdated.  
* Our decision making processes & control mechanisms move far slower than how things actually work and evolve.  
* Humans today are not smart enough to solve all of our problems.  
* We are not incentivized to help each other.  
* Democracy has outlived its usefulness.  
* Dictatorships are not necessarily bad.  
* 2 party system is absurd.  
* Political ideologies are stupid.

* Civilians owning guns is bad.  
* The ways to get into public office are highly outdated.
