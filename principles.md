**Primer:**

The backstory behind this page is [here](/2017/09/30/codex-vitae/). This was inspired by [Ray Dalio’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) original [Principles](https://cldup.com/rrhmdLUQeD.pdf) document. Some of these are original and some borrowed from those smarter than me. Thanks to everyone out there that helped (both explicitly and implicitly).

* Live in the moment.  
* Money is circulated. Time is spent.  
* Self improvement & mastery are the key to happiness.  
* Separate what you can control & what you can't. Focus on the former and ignore the latter. 
* Quality > quantity in virtually everything.
* Focus on the important things. Real work > work work.  
* Motion is not the same as progress.  
* Always think and plan for the long term.    
* Work backwards from the desired end state.  
* Truth is that which has predictive power.  
* When in doubt, honesty is a good policy.  
* Communication is fundamental to any relationship.  
* And relationships are fundamental to everything else.  
* You are the average of the 5 people you’re around.  
* Everyone has biases & emotions, but ultimately facts should drive beliefs & action.  
* No decision is perfect. Do your best and move on.
* Done is better than perfect. 
* There are no shortcuts in life. 
* Foundation is everything. Without foundation, you have nothing.  
* The vast majority of your efforts will not lead to the desired outcome. But that doesn’t mean those efforts were wasted.  
* What got you to here won’t get you to the next step.   
* What got you here is holding you back from the next step.  
* Life is a machine. Design it as such.  
* Do it all. You only get one life, minimize regret.  
* Seek conflicting opinions.  
* The greatest things in life are compounding.
