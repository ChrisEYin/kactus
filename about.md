Hello! I'm Chris Yin -- 26 years old living in the Bay Area working at [Coupa](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupa), a late stage enterprise software startup as the lead Product Manager for Expenses, Inventory, and Mobile. 

A little about myself -- I grew up in a small town in the Bay Area. I moved down to San Diego to go to college at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). While I was there, I met some awesome people and started [Pathways](http://rady.ucsd.edu/ciid/pathways-ventures/), a group that worked together on various projects & startups. 

While at Pathways, I spent a lot of time at [AIC](http://ansirsd.com/), a coworking space, and got to work with some cool companies like [ADI](http://nextshark.com/ecoqube-how-this-startup-can-seriously-end-world-hunger/), [PremedHQ](http://www.premedhq.com), [Xpenser](http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/06/xpenser-is-the-tripit-for-expense-tracking/), [KA Lite](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131030-net-lessons-for-worlds-poorest), [LocBit](http://ivn.us/2012/12/08/locbit-young-ceo-amongst-citys-core-startups/) and more. Eventually UCSD decided they wanted Pathways, and we [passed it to them](http://rady.ucsd.edu/ciid/pathways-ventures/).

After finshing undergrad, I spent some time working and learning how to build software, eventually joining [Parand](https://twitter.com/parand) at [Xpenser](http://xpenser.com/). After a few months, we were [acquired by Coupa](http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2013/04/18/acquired-or-acq-hired-xpenser-adds-expertise-to-coupas-web-services/), a company out of San Mateo. 

I've been a PM at Coupa since and I lead the way building a few of our products -- [Expenses](http://www.coupa.com/solutions/expense-management-software), [Inventory](http://www.coupa.com/solutions/inventory-system), and Mobile ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coupa-expense-reports-requisitions/id599455669?mt=8) & [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coupa.android.coupamobile&hl=en)). Perpetually working on a few side projects ([let's chat!](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=christopher.e.yin@gmail.com)), and always down to meet up with cool people.
