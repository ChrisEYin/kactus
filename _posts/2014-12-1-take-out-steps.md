Mail to Self showed up on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mail-to-self) today. It's an app that allows you to easily email a note to yourself from anywhere while on your phone.

Emailing myself a note is something I do all the time, despite all the other (and arguably better) options. There's something very familiar and safe about it. 

I immediately downloaded the app. And from looking at Product Hunt rankings and the App Store ratings, seems like I'm not the only one. 

What I loved about this product was how beautifully simple it was. The app is squarely focused on solving a clear problem and getting out of your way. Its not a big product with a revolutionary approach, but it identifies an existing behavior and solves a problem. 

It's a very small example, but it reminds me of [Ev Williams' saying for building products](http://www.wired.com/2013/09/ev-williams-xoxo/).

>“Take a human desire, preferably one that has been around for a really long time. Identify that desire and use modern technology to take out steps.”

Will the product last longer term? That I don't know. Most people are not early adopters, and need to ease into new behaviors. So while this particular product is only relevant while this behavior exists, building products with this approach builds trust with your users so you can grow with them as they change behaviors.
