In college I started an entrepreneurs group with a set of friends. The intent was to get some people together that were interested in building things and boost UCSD’s startup spirit. 

At some point we went to a UCSD demo day. And while there were some fantastic projects there, what stood out to me was a guy that I met there. The guy’s name was Kevin, a 1st year at UCSD out of SF. He told me a little bit about his background – back in high school he had run a fairly successful business selling exotic aqua-life/aquariums out of his garage and was there just to soak in UCSD’s entrepreneurs’ scene. 

I immediately reached out to him afterwards and we met up to spend some time chatting about ideas and what he wanted to do. At the time, he was interested in starting up a services business setting up high-end aquariums (pictured above. Aside – those run from $10-$50k a piece + regular maintenance fees).

While I knew absolutely nothing about this business, what I loved was his energy and his authenticity. He’s incredibly knowledgeable about the space and a longtime fish/shrimp enthusiast – in high school he started a blog about his work. The blog ended up being getting a ton of visitors and he built up quite an audience that then became his customers. In addition, he had a ton of credibility, having set up extensive aquariums for high net worth individuals and some large institutions. He put that all on pause to go to college, but after a few months he couldn’t sit still and was tinkering around with a few ideas again.

I was impressed. His passion was contagious – you could tell this was the only thing he ever wanted to work on. He genuinely loved the space and was constantly expanding the breadth and depth of his knowledge. On the other end, his ability to execute was equally impressive -- he worked incredibly hard, had a ‘get shit done’ attitude, and had the right mix of naivete and stubbornness – he was never daunted and would push through regardless of any challenges that arose. 

After we talked, he decided to go forward and start doing side projects again. And what started out as an idea to do high-end installations eventually morphed into [an ecommerce site](http://aquadesigninnovations.com/shop/all/) for selling exotic fish out of his apartment. It was a high margin business that was going well, but the logistics were draining -- especially for his team of 2 people.

We decided to shift focus onto products. He designed a series of aquaponic systems, recruited materials engineers, prototyped numerous ideas with 3D printers, and then hustled to run [a very successful Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevinzl/ecoqube-desktop-ecosystem-that-grow-flowers-and-he) netting him ~$80k and just under 600 orders. He took that to China to find manufactures, build, package, and distribute his product. While he was doing this, he got the attention of Petco, and has found a partner & a fantastic distribution channel for his current and upcoming products.

Over the years I’ve had the opportunity to watch Kevin grow tremendously. He’s an incredible entrepreneur with a great sense of product and such a deep knowledge of his space. He’s been working his ass and is on his way to building a great business, recently closing his first round of real funding. It has been fantastic getting the chance to work with him, and I’m excited to be joining his board and continue helping him become successful.

What I've learned from all of this is to always invest in the people, not ideas. When vetting the people, remember that authenticity is the most important attribute -- in ADI's case, while the idea has shifted, the passion for the space has never changed. The dedication and resilience to multiple years of pivoting is really hard to fake. In addition, being a hustler coupled with naivete and stubbornness (naive enough to not be daunted by challenges, stubborn enough to push through anyway) make for incredible entrepreneurs.
