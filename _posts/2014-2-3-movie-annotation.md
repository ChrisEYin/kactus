Over the last year, have been working on a small side project to help people understand movies/tv shows better. A lot of times after I watch something, I'll lurk on Wikipedia/IMDB/Reddit etc to find answers to any outstanding questions. Sometimes just I'll casually float around the web to revisit some of the scenes, discover any subtleties I may have missed, or just talk about how awesome/shitty something was. Some notable times I've done this -- after [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/faq), [Prometheus](http://www.prometheus2-movie.com/community/forums/42), and after every [Breaking Bad](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad) episode in the second half of Season 5. 

I would spend a fair amount of time collecting bits of information from around the web, consolidating it into my mind to form a cohesive story, explain it to a friend, and then I'd be satisfied. But it was a massive time suck and an enormous pain in the ass. To find the info I'd have to scour the web -- on one end, going through generic synopses on Wikipedia (usually really high level and poorly written) and then all the way down to crawling through IMDB boards/Reddit (essentially internet forums -- and we know how these are. Have to wade through tons of shit to hopefully find 1 nugget of good info). 

To get any real answers/insight into questions, some serious internet investigation would have to take place. Sometimes you'd find a decent answer on Wikipedia, follow it up with a good comment in Reddit, then have to read someone's take on a random blog post. Once again -- a massive pain in the ass, and it wasn't easy to share the end result with other people.

With a friend, I decided to build a new way to do this. We're on V2 now, but in the meantime -- to quickly test the general thesis of this idea (do people even care about reading more into film/tv shows?), I did an annotation of ["The Godfather"](http://bit.ly/1dwjTCc) on [PoetryGenius](http://poetry.rapgenius.com/) & shared with the [RapGenius](http://poetry.rapgenius.com/tv-movie-genius) community. The response was pretty awesome -- got a lot of comments, messages, feedback, and views pretty quickly. Even floated over to popular posts on the home page for some time.

Overall, it was pretty cool to share the annotation with other people and see other people care about it. The annotation style on Rapgenius is not exactly how I imagine this working, but it's close enough for a quick test. Going to continue working to finish V2, but in the meantime will do a few more types of annotations and share to see if it continues to resonate.
