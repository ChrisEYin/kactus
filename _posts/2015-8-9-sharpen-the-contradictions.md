As companies grow, more people join. When more people join, people with different opinions begin to work together. And at some point, you run into disageements.

In a smaller group, it’s easier to disagree and voice your opinions. When the group becomes larger and there are more people/layers/departments/etc, it gets harder to voice your opinion — you have to wade through more pools of shit to get your thoughts across. That can lead to people giving up and just conforming with the group. 

That’s a dangerous place for a company to be. It’s a symptom that truth is no longer the most important thing. Truth is the most critical ingredient for good ideas to surface, and when other things become more important than truth, the company begins to slowly die. 

I really like [Ben Horowitz’s framing of this here](http://a16z.com/2015/07/11/12-things-ive-learned-from-ben-horowitz-about-management-investing-and-business/): 

> ‘Conflict is where the truth is. And so when there’s a conflict in the organization, you do not want to smooth it over. You want to sharpen the contradictions, heat up both opinions, and resolve it.’

So when there’s a problem in your organization, don’t try and quickly resolve it and make everyone ‘happy’ again. You need to play the moderator, heat that shit up, and make sure things are resolved. Otherwise you’re brushing things under the rug and accruing debt that will come back to bite you later.

In my experience with this, some people fundamentally disagree on everything. You can spend a lot of time trying to resolve their arguments, and it always results in a stalemate - agree to disagree. 

This is when great leadership really shines. A great leader will spend the time and really dig into what the differences are and what’s causing the disagreement. Again, in my experience, it’s either just a misunderstanding between each other’s intentions (some people just rub each other the wrong way) or a fundamental conflict. 

In both cases, you need to go default back to truth. Find out what is causing the disagreement (typically a difference in beliefs/intentions), and if just a misunderstanding, bring it to light and resolve it. However, if this doesn't work, someone is not holding up their end, and you have to take action right away or it can easily spiral into something more serious.
