Recently I’ve been seeing more and more ‘personal assistant' scheduling products coming out, touting the ability to relieve you of wasted time scheduling meetings.

Ostensibly these products were built and designed to make money at some point. As a consumer, I use calendaring infrequently – occasional get togethers, errands, etc. Not enough to spend money on a service. The bulk of calendar pain is work related -- so these products must be targeted at a business audience. 

If that’s true, the apps today are missing the mark. The majority of the apps I've tried function the same way – cc an alias and they’ll help you schedule a meeting. What they don't mention is that they're really optimized for basic meetings (1:1, immediate scheduling, etc). 

The pain is not around basic meetings – it’s around the complex ones. Coordinating between multiple people. Multiple time zones. Adding a conference call dial in to every meeting. Then cancelling and rescheduling. 

These products fail under the strain of complex meetings. Either a delay in response (invites never show up) or just silently failing. That type of slip or delay at work can be extremely costly. There is little room & patience for error -- and when ~85% of meetings are complex, the supposed benefits of the product are quickly overshadowed by its shortcomings.

Now, I realize that many of these products are early stage and MVP’s. However - either they didn’t fully understand the problem or their MVP is coming up short. An MVP is the shortest & quickest path to prove out a solution. These products have proved the existence of a problem, but not a solution. 

In my eyes, an MVP for this type of product is at a minimum - multiple person scheduling, possibly automated conf call dial ins in the invite. A V2 (possibly a paid version, leaving the base product free) is the ability to configure personal preferences. ie for me – no calls on Tuesdays, prefer to take them from 2-6pm PT. Another element is factoring in meeting priority and rescheduling and reprioritizing based on that. 

While I’m confident we’ll get there eventually, the early incarnations of the software’s shortcomings and frustrations are far greater than value add.
