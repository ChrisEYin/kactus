[Josh Miller](https://twitter.com/joshm) just released a new app called Rooms. The intent is to create a place where you can chat and share images in different topic based rooms. [Check it out here](http://www.rooms.me/).

Josh comes from created [Branch](http://branch.com/), backed by [Obvious](http://obvious.com). Facebook then [acquired them](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/facebook-acquires-branch/), this product makes a lot of sense for them.

While it’s certainly really well done and a fun app to play with, I haven’t found great utility with it yet. I don’t see a problem or purpose for it, and the general sentiment has been similar -- do we really need another place to chat about nonsense? I’m not convinced. 

But there is an interesting piece in the app. Each chat room in the app has a QR code attached to it. And in order to join any room, you need to scan it – either via camera or through a screenshot (screenshot the QR code, and upload it). First time I’ve seen this particular interaction.

In a [Wired post](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/facebook-rooms-app/), Josh explains that joining rooms is a core part of the app -- but while sharing links is native on the web, it’s not easy on mobile. On mobile, images are the native form of data. So they created this new way to share rooms – QR codes on mobile. 

Loved the thought process and the experimentation here, hope to see more of this.
