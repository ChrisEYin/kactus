As 2015 comes to a close, I start to look back and reflect a bit on what I did / accomplished this year. 

One of those things is taking a look at what I read. Below is a list.

__1. [Zero to One](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/)__  

This book evolved from [a set of notes](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) that [Blake Masters](https://twitter.com/bgmasters) published from a Stanford class [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) was teaching on startups. 

Peter is an incredibly broad thinker with some fairly contrarian views on how to build the future. The book is great and challenged some of the ideas that I held about starting up. Anyone starting up should give it a read. 

__2. [The Everything Store](http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0316219282/)__

The birth and rise of Amazon with a focus on Jeff Bezos. A great look into a fascinating leader -- his ability to think incredibly long term and his discipline in maintaining such a supreme focus on the customer is second to none.

While I thought it was an interesting book, MacKenzie Bezos (Jeff's wife) didn't take too kindly to it and wrote a pretty [harsh review of the book here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0T26SV0ELPP/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm/?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316219266&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=). Still, a fun read.

__3. [The Score Takes Care of Itself](http://www.amazon.com/Score-Takes-Care-Itself-Philosophy/dp/1591843472/)__

[Bill Walsh's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_%28American_football_coach%29) leadership lessons. A football legend that took the worst team in the NFL (the 49ers) and completely revamped the organization, leading them to win 3 championships. 

It's fairly football heavy, but filled with practical advice that is applicable to all leaders (even if you don't like football). The man's precision and attention to detail is amazing.

__4. [High Output Management](http://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/)__

Easily top 5 management books of all time. Written by [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove), one of the greatest technology CEO's to ever live. A very detailed and tactical look at what management is and how to become the best. 

Anyone (tech or not) leading & managing people needs to read this book. I wrote up [my own summary here](/2015/07/01/high-output-mgmt/).

__5. [How Google Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344/)__

[Eric Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt) (former Google CEO) and [Jonathan Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenberg_%28technologist%29) (former Google SVP of Products) recount their experience building Google and what they learned about building digital products in the internet age. 

A great read for anyone working in technology. I wrote up [my summary here](/2015/05/25/how-google-works/).

__6. [Naked Statistics](http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data/dp/039334777X/)__

Naked Statistics explains how stats work in a simple and fun way. Charles Wheelan is great at providing tangible examples that make stats relatable to anyone. Some of the topics are a bit rudimentary, but still a worthwhile and fun read.

__7. [Becoming Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347405)__

Brent Schlender, a longtime friend of Steve Jobs, gives us a fascinating inside look at one of the most well known technology leaders of our time. 

What I loved about this book was how real it felt. The book shows Steve's struggles & mistakes -- and ultimately how he grew into the leader we all know today. A fantastic read.  

__8. [A Short History of Nearly Everything](http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/076790818X/)__

Bill Bryson takes you through a really fun journey exploring literally everything -- the birth of the universe, rise of civilization, etc. An amazing book that covers so much, it will leave you inspired and diving deeper into several of the different topics he explores.

So that's what I read in 2015. I've got a long list of books for 2016, and will push that one when I narrow it down. Any thoughts / questions / suggestions, leave it in the comments or [drop me a line](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=christopher.e.yin@gmail.com). 

One thing I'd like to change is how I read these books. I 'read' a lot of these as audiobooks (when driving, on the train, etc), which is super accessible and convenient. But I wasn't able to take notes as well and found myself constantly physically re-reading bits and pieces to remember some of the finer details. So planning on doing more reading on the Kindle for 2016. Thoughts, ideas, let me know!
