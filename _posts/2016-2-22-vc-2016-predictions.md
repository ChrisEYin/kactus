To start off 2016, it’s always fun to make some predictions about what’s going to happen in the upcoming year. 

In addition to coming up with my own predictions, I also read through a bunch of posts from smart people. So I figured I’d consolidate it and share.

The ones I liked the best were [Fred Wilson of USV](http://avc.com/2016/01/what-is-going-to-happen-in-2016/), [Edith Yeung of 500 Startups](http://www.edith.co/blog/2016-technology-predictions),  [Clement Vouillon of Point 9 Capital](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/7-trends-that-will-shape-the-saas-industry-in-2016-3bf367d898cc#.mt86kdaqa), [Tomasz Tunguz of Redpoint](http://tomtunguz.com/hottest-startup-sectors-2016/), [Emergence Capital](http://techcrunch.com/gallery/predictions-for-2016-from-emergence-capital-partners/), [Brian Asher of Venrock](https://vcwaves.com/2016/01/08/predictions-for-2016-self-driving-cars-ai-and-brain-monitoring/), [Rick Yang of NEA](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/31/one-venture-capitalists-predictions-for-2016.html), [Sergio Monsalve of Norwest](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/29/venture-capital-its-not-all-gloom-and-doom-in-2016-commentary.html), [Josh Elman of Greylock](https://medium.com/@joshelman/thank-you-2015-bring-on-2016-b1f52db950ef#.bza142xgu), and [Kevin Rose of Hodinkee](https://medium.com/@kevinrose/five-tech-predictions-for-2016-d1435d9423b4#.5xc0orq2v).

The hottest topics were (by number of mentions): 

1. VR  
2. AI  
3. Slackbots / Messaging  
4. IoT  
5. Cars  
6. Bitcoin

__VR__

tl;dr - VR will have many use cases outside of entertainment. People are skeptical of high price tag and consumer impact/appeal in year 1.

Fred Wilson - Initial commercial versions of Oculus technology will underwhelm. Games will be the strongest early use case, but not everyone is going to want to put on a headset to play a game. I think VR will only reach its true potential when they figure out how to deploy it in a more natural way.

Sergio - VR will go beyond entertainment. The NFL, UN, Air Force, etc are already using VR as part of their training systems. Tommy Hilfiger is the first major retailer to offer a virtual shopping trip. Will continue into education, defense, sports, enterprise productivity, and retail. 

Emergence - VR will start out supporting high value workers like physicians or high value projects like oil rigs who can justify the cost of the hardware.

Kevin Rose - Virtual Reality will turn out to be a dud. Great initial “wow” experience, but ultimately just a big chunk of tech that will collect dust in the corner. I see this very much like the Wii controller and 3DTV, innovative, sure, but in the drawer after the novelty wears off.

Edith - Facebook, Microsoft and Samsung (or may be Xiaomi) will play major roles. VR isn't a single breakthrough, it's a combined breakthrough of 3D imaging, eye tracking and motion (or even emotion) sensing.

Rick - Real growth in VR will come from adoption of the more lightweight mobile VR headsets like the Samsung Gear VR — which is powered by Oculus — and Google's Cardboard.

__AI__

tl;dr - Huge potential, but in its early phases will only be really valuable in specific use cases (still figuring out which ones). Infrastructure and education will continue. Big companies will play a large role. 

Edith - AI will emerge as a service platform - Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Baidu, Apple and Amazon will all push forward with their own AI standards. Your apps or OS will automatically manage and structure your interactions with data. Beyond natural language queries, there will be breakthrough to interpret your emotion. 

Clement - Continuation of both trends, education and infrastructure. Still need more education and more easy to use / developer friendly APIs before AI really becomes ubiquitous (who will be the Stripe / Twilio / Algolia of AI and automation?). In the meantime the really impressive apps will still come from the big players like Google, Facebook, Tesla or research projects which have the resources to push the limits of this field.

Brian - AI will enable automation of the rote components across a huge spectrum of jobs categories including dietary/fitness training, customer service, financial advice, education, and medicine, freeing up humans to focus on the most value added components of these occupations.

Emergence - Machine learning, artificial intelligence, NLP, etc will be the buzzword of 2016 in the enterprise, but only applied to specific domains.  

__Slack / Messaging__

tl;dr - Messaging first/only applications will start to take off. A couple awesome ones will emerge, with slack being the favorite platform.

Clement - 2016 will probably see the boom of third party tools and an increasing number of VC rounds to fuel them. That said it’s still uncertain how the messaging platform operators are going to deal with their ecosystem and there’s always a risk that they end up doing what Twitter or LinkedIn did (and kill their ecosystem). Slack seems to be heading the good direction with its dedicated fund though.

Fred - Slack will become so pervasive inside of enterprises that spam will become a problem and third party Slack spam filters will emerge. At the same time, the Slack platform will take off and building Slack bots will become the next big thing in enterprise software.

Kevin Rose - Slack APIs will mature, with that expect serious ($100M+) businesses to be built on this platform.

Edith - Facebook Messenger will finally roll out consumer to business payment support and make it available for third-party developers to build on top of it. WeChat will also open up its existing (China-only for now) APIs to rest the world.

__Wearables / IoT__

tl;dr - Wearables will expand beyond watches and fitness. 

Fred Wilson - A new form of wearables take off in 2016. The wrist is not the only place we might want to wear a computer on our bodies. If I had to guess, I would bet on something we wear in or on our ears.

Emergence - IoT will show early promise for vertical specific use cases, like manufacturing / healthcare, particular for blending sensor data & predictive analytics.

Brian - We’ll see mindfulness training become front and center in 2016 in wearable device form.

Kevin Rose - Apple Watch 2 will launch and have mediocre success. Eventually they will realize the device they should have built would be more akin to a Fitbit with long battery life and a simple display. At this point they’ll either buy Fitbit or develop their own.

__Autonomous Cars__

tl;dr - People are excited about autonomous cars. 

Brian - Self-driving vehicles hit the road for real, led by commercial trucks on interstate highways. 

Rick - Telsa and those guys are going to be very well poised as regulation allows them to step beyond the bounds of the features they're building today from an autonomous driving standpoint.

Edith - Automakers want to be mobile developers. The first driverless car will be launched by end of 2016.

__Bitcoin__

tl;dr - People are still on both sides of the bitcoin argument. 

Fred Wilson - Bitcoin finally finds a killer app with the emergence of Open Bazaar protocol powered zero take rate marketplaces. (note that OB1, an open bazaar powered service, is a USV portfolio company).

Kevin Rose - Cryptocurrency will continue to be used by a niche audience. It’s too technical and doesn’t offer any advantage to the average Joe. This reminds me when people told me the future of identity was getting consumers to type in their URL and password (OpenID).

And specific to SaaS, the hype is all around Industry Cloud (Vertical SaaS), mobile first SaaS, marketplaces, and the above -- messaging, AI, VR (more on these later).
