Last week I went to Redpoint’s [SaaS Office Hours](http://saasofficehours.com/) with [Tomasz Tunguz](https://twitter.com/ttunguz) (Partner at [Redpoint](http://www.redpoint.com/)) and [Maia Josebachvili](https://twitter.com/Josebachvili) (VP of People & Strategy at [Greenhouse](http://greenhouse.io/)). 

Maia laid out a framework that her team at Greenhouse uses to optimize their recruiting process. Ultimately what drives success is fairly simple -- it's all about being prepared and knowing what you're looking for. 

At Greenhouse, the people team works with each team that is hiring to make sure that they have a clear understanding of what they're looking for. This should be mapped into short term requirements (existing skills) and longer term goals (personality & attitude). 

An easy way to think about this is on a 2x2 graph where the axis are 'performance' and 'culture fit'. You're should only be hiring those in the top right quadrant. It's can be tempting to hire high performers with low culture fit, but this doesn't pay off long term (for either you or them).

As for the interview itself, it's important that the various interviewers know what the spec is and that they're testing/evaluating against that. To help with this, there are 2 common types of questions -- situational and behavioral. 

Situational is a 'tell me about a time' type of question to help evaluate somebody's skill set. 'How would you handle this situation' is more behavioral, and this can help you inform you about a candidate's personality and how this person will likely shake out longer term. 

Now for some metrics to help you understand and evaluate how your recruiting process is performing:  

1. Qualified Candidates
2. Days to Close
3. Candidate Satisfaction
4. Offer Acceptance Rate
5. Hires to Goal

__Qualified Candidates__

This is the number of candidates making it to a phone screen. Will help you get a sense of the quality of where you're fishing from. Reviewing hundreds of candidates is meaningless -- the only thing that matters are potential hires. For a regular candidate, 15 QC to 1 closed is good. For engineering, 25 to 1.

__Days to Close__

How long it takes to close out, start to finish? Good candidates typically have options, so the faster, the better. Also can help you understand how well your process is run, different bottlenecks, etc.

__Candidate Satisfaction__

Just because someone doesn't get a job doesn't mean they should walk away with negative feelings about your company. Your recruiting process can be another way to create evangelists. Send your candidates a survey after (similar to NPS) to see how you're doing. Companies using Greenhouse are seeing between 75-85%.

__Offer Acceptance Rate__

This one is obvious. Acceptance rate helps you measure your ability to close. If it's low, it's not good. If you’re under 80%, you might have a real problem on your hands -- either the offer, company, role, how you're pitching, etc. 

__Hire to Goal__

Most departments have hiring goals set out either annually or quarterly. This is a periodic check to see how each team is hiring against these goals and if they're on track to hit it.

One that I would add as a lagging indicator is a post hire metric -- is the candidate is still here after 6 months, 12 months, 18 months? Another that would be interesting is some sense of performance (although tough to measure).

Overall, the net of it is -- have a clear definition of what you're looking for and then make sure you're testing for it.
