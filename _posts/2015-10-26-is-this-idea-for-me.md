I spend a lot of time with friends thinking through and coming up with ideas for new products / services. A lot of the ones I come up with are garbage, but once in a while I’ll hit one that seems promising.

When I find one of these, before I run off to start mocking something up, here’s a quick framework that I use to determine whether I should pursue the idea further or not. 

__1. How passionate am I about this space?__

I’m a strong believer that you have to love whatever you’re doing in order to be the best at it. You have to [constantly be thinking about the problem you’re trying to solve](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html) in order to find the answer. You have to keep trying new ideas, failing, and then trying again. 

Without deep passion for whatever you're doing, it’s likely the constant failure will wear on you and cause you to give up. So the first thing is always to look at yourself and make sure this is a space you really love.

__2. Am I the right person to solve this?__

When starting up, it’s not just about solving the right problem. You have to be the right person to solve it. Ideas are great, but execution is the real key. Lots of people can see opportunity. But only a handful can actually execute against it. 

A lot of times this means somebody who is really well versed in the problem or that particular space. This way they'll more likely have developed a unique perspective, have a network of customers / partners / employees, and just have an easier time getting the right product to the right people quickly.

But it doesn’t have to be. Ultimately, it’s about having a unique and deep insight into the future. And then being able to quickly build, distribute, support, and grow your solution. 

__3. Why is now the right time?__

Not only do I have to be the right person, it has to be the right time to solve this problem. Something has to have changed, shfited or emerged in order to provide an opportunity to solve this problem where we couldn't before. Whether it's a new technology, behavior, pattern, etc. 

A suitable answer here would be -- now is a great time to build a tool to easily allow app develoeprs to incorporate mobile payments into their software because of smartphone proliferation, rising consumer time spent on smartphones, and changing consumer behavior in regards to shopping. A not so great answer would be -- I just figured this out and so now is the time to do it.

__4. Would I mind working with these people (users / customers) all day, everyday?__

You can always control who you hire, but you can’t control the type of users / customers that you have to deal with. And so you absolutely have to be able to work, hang out, and live with the people you’re building a solution for. If you can’t spend all day everyday in a room with these people, they will wear you out and cause you to give up.

I once tried to start something similar to StyleSeat. I was talking to my stylist while I was getting a haircut and she was explaining the industry to me. Everything she said just seemed absurd to me (stylists are individual contractors, they rent a chair from the store, have to bring their own tools, but use a centrally managed booking system, etc). The stylist was their own business, but the tools were built for the store, who was really a just real estate vendor.

So after my haircut I called a few other stylists, validated the problem, and started mocking up a solution. But after I got a few people interested and ready to try something out, I started lagging. I had trouble finding the motivation to keep cold calling stylists all day and to try and get them onto my solution. 

After a few more weeks, I realized that this wasn’t the one. While I was still convinced it was a good idea, I wasn't the right person to do this. I had never really cared about hair as a consumer, and wasn’t deeply invested in this space or this problem. I didn’t connect very well with stylists as I was a complete outsider to their world (I was a random dude trying to sell software to a bunch of women). 

So I set this one down. And then a year or so later, I found [StyleSeat](https://www.styleseat.com/), and [Melody](https://pando.com/2012/11/01/sacca-styleseat-is-likely-to-become-my-third-or-fourth-best-investment/) seemed to have all of the right traits. And so that’s why she now has a great business and I’m here writing a blog post :).
