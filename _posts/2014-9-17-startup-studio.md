The startup studio. Every entrepreneur I know dreams about building a startup studio, myself included. 

A startup studio is simply an umbrella organization grouping together a set of ideas & products. What’s great about the studio model is that you're not tied to any 1 thing like a company is. You're not constrained to any particular sector, idea, product, etc. -- you’re starting with nothing but some general hypotheses, and you can go in any direction you like.

What’s awesome about this is the experimental nature of the startup studio. You can explore a variety of ideas at once that can be unrelated or even conflicting -- and quickly start/kill any of them at any time. You're free to think, explore, and learn much faster than you would ordinarily.

Startups are hard and scary. In many cases, the end result of a startup has very little to do with the original idea. So the studio model lets you explore and experiement. If you have some inclination, you build & test it. If something isn’t working, you put it to rest and take your lessons. And if something works, you can spin it out and push it further.

What I love about this is the freedom to practice and exercise the 0 → 1 muscle. [As Peter Thiel has noted](http://blakemasters.com/post/20400301508/cs183class1), 0 → 1 is the most difficult stage of building companies, but also the most fun and exciting. And I would love to spend my time focused on that.

The retort that I hear from people is about a seeming lack of results & focus. If we look at the existing ones -- [Betaworks](http://betaworks.com/), [Expa](http://expa.com/), [Obvious](https://medium.com/obvious), [North](http://www.n-o-r-t-h-t-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-i-e-s.com/), [HVF](http://www.hvflabs.com/), and even [Rocket Internet](https://www.rocket-internet.com/) -- there is a consistnent thesis behind every studio. And some great companies have already been built from these groups. 

And it's fairly early still in the lifetime of these studios, so we'll see in a few years how they fair. But the results so far look good.
