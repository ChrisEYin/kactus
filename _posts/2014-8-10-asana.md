I love Asana. I live in it and very literally would not know what to do without it. This is a quick rambling on why :).

When you open up the app for the first time, Asana resembles a blank todo list. Once you see it, you already know what to do – create tasks. The application opens with a very familiar UX for the end user. Simplicity and ease of use.

But that alone isn’t enough. While a simple todo list is great, there’s nothing different about that than any other task management app -- Todoist, Wunderlist, Any.do, Clear, etc. The UX is the same across the board – here’s a blank list, start adding some tasks. Nothing groundbreaking.

What’s great about a todo list is that everybody knows what it is and how to use it. But a todo list alone is not enough. A quick observation into how many people use task management apps shows 2 main behaviors – people either try it and eventually go back to what they’re used to (writing it down, emailing it to yourself, keeping it in your head, evernote), or they fill it up with everything and then never revisit it. 

Todo list apps pick up steam quickly because everybody understands the basic principle. But the reason people also burn out on them so quickly is that the present day understanding of a todo list is that it’s for the short term. Tasks for the day, grocery lists, etc. You finish it and move on.

But true task management is more than just short term tasks. A major component of life is managing the long term. But managing a long term todo list is hard. Because of the dynamic nature of long term projects, the long term todo list is constantly changing and shifting – new tasks pop up & old ones go away. Some tasks stay open for a long time and need notes. Some tasks require multiple people, documents, etc. And not all tasks in a long term project are relevant at the same time. So what happens is you create a long term task list, and you're either recreating it over and over, can't fit everything in there, or something else. Regardless, the todo list can begin to become a job to maintain instead of empowering you to work more.

So todo lists are great for the short term, but not so much for longer term projects. What is great about Asana is that it gets us closer to combining short term and long term into a single application. While everything starts out as a task - as you continue to build on it, you can group them together into a project. You can tag things, create sub projects into tasks, add headers, subtasks, due dates, documents, comments, collaborators, etc. So you start with a simple task list and over time you create projects, and sub projects. Then you can use the due date / timing functionality to only surface what’s important to you when you need it. Storing the long term, but only exposing the short term to the user.

In short, the beauty of Asana is the simplicity. A familiar and intuitive UX, but also with powerful features & workflow built in and hidden to the end user until they need them. Also, a non trivial part of Asana's success is Luna. Your task manager just has to work and not slow you down, and Asana's web app is one of the best I have ever used. 

While the other apps above share some of the features geared at managing longer term tasks/projects, they  lack in one way or another some or the power user tools that really help bridge the gap from short term to long term task list.

While Asana is fantastic, there are just a few things that I'd like to see it expand on -

**More tools for long term projects**

While Asana's power user tools help you focus on the short term & plan for the long term,  it’s not perfect. Longer term projects are comprised of tasks, but those tasks live independently of each other. A way to improve the ability to manage longer term projects in Asana would be task dependencies - complete task X, task Y is auto assigned to you. Another would be a tool to help you revisit projects. In today's world where a single person runs multiple concurrent projects, the ability to alert the user that Project X has seen no work in awhile or have Project X resurface after completion of Project Y would be extremely helpful.

**Priorities**

Separation between important and not important. This is a tricky one, but the essence is that some tasks are more/less important than others. When you use Asana as a single source of truth, there can be a lot of things in there. What I'm starting to see is task creep. I forward everything into Asana, and so I can easily be overwhelmed by all the things I need to do. It feels like my inbox. What I want to easily pull out of Asana is the 2 things that I really need to do today, and leave everything else as a secondary task until these important ones are done.
