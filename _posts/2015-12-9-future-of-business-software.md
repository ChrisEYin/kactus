SaaS has redefined the business software landscape. [Salesforce](https://www.google.com/finance?q=crm), [Workday](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:WDAY), [Netsuite](https://www.google.com/finance?q=N), [Zendesk](https://www.google.com/finance?q=zen), [Mindbody](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=928465089682890) etc. all displaced incumbents with best of breed SaaS applications. It’s gone from [being dismissed](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2683815/cloud-computing/larry-ellison-s-cloud-tirade--why-he-s-so-scared.html) to creating dozens of public companies [worth billions of dollars](http://www.bvp.com/blog/state-cloud-2015).

But now these applications must evolve or face the same fate as the former incumbents. A technology shift is coming that will rewrite  much of what buisness software is today. 

Fundamentally, cloud computing is still just a database with a UI on top and some basic functionality around it (some logic, workflow, etc). You can take this data with you anywhere (web & mobile), but you’re still typing in data and running basic queries to extract what you need. A digital courier & file cabinet. 

Let's take Zendesk. Today, customers have to manually type up support tickets when they have issues. And then someone else on the other end has to read them, figure out the answer, respond, etc. You can check on the go with mobile, report on ticket volumes, etc. But at the end of the day, there's no intelligence behind it. You're just storing data with some semblance of structure so you can report on it or find it later.

Also Salesforce. Today, sales people are manually creating opportunities and logging details about them — calls, emails, updates, etc. Again, you can run pull up the customer info on your phone, reports on what is forecasted, etc. But again - manually entering in data and storing it online to deal with it later. No intelligence behind it. 

Today's software is good at storing, transmitting & presenting data, but not good at making sense of it. Images, audio, video, data from multiple sources, unstructured data, even really understanding words is not easy in today's systems. So humans have to do this - but we're very slow, inefficient, and sometimes just plain wrong. 

Enter machine intelligence. With machine learning, computers can now understand meaning and sentiment behind words. They can recognize images. Listen to audio and understand it. Quickly parse through massive & disparate data sets and find insights. And they can continuously improve their own algorithms and keep getting better. 

With the ability to make sense of lots of data very quickly, it's clear that machine intelligence will begin to do this type of work for us. And applications that just store, transmit, and present data will be overrun by those that can actually understand the data and make sense of it. 

While this may all sound obvious, historically we haven’t been ready for it. Whether it’s processing power, volume of data, etc. But now the technology is getting good enough, we have a lot of data, and most businesses (and people) increasingly rely on computers for everything. So it appears that we are now ready. 

So what if instead of having customers file support tickets and having someone on the other end manually reviewing them - [a machine could understand the words in the ticket](https://www.inbenta.com/en) (not just keyword search), investigate the product, and give you the right answer? 

What if instead of entering in details about a call into your CRM, [your phone calls logged themselves and the audio searchable](https://www.gridspace.com/)? Or even better, the system could understand the phone convo realtime & serve up relevant information you need to push along the deal? 

This is the future we’re looking at in software. Less storage, processing, querying, etc. It will be all about accurately & quickly drawing insights from data programmatically and at scale. 

For a primer on this space, [Shivon](twitter.com/shivon) of [Bloomberg Beta](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual) wrote a [great post on it here](https://medium.com/@shivon/the-current-state-of-machine-intelligence-f76c20db2fe1#.dti4wqg69).
