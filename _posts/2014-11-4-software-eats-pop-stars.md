A few weeks ago, a friend of mine showed me [Hatsune Miku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku), the famous Japanese virtual pop star.

She's a digital image of a 16 year old female cartoon. Somebody writes the lyrics, does the animations, and she is the public face of all of this.

She's incredibly popular - not just millions of Youtube views, but also tons of sold out live concerts. She's more prolific than any other singer -- over 22,000 original songs and featured in over 100,000 others. And needless to say, she makes money hand over fist. Recently she even [came to Letterman](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/who-the-heck-is-hatsune-miku) to perform. Take a look.

In line with [software eats the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460), fascinating to watch this applied to music. Will be interesting to continue watching this unfold and see software continue to eat more things.
