A few days ago [Amazon Dash](https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button) launched. While initially thinking it was an April Fool’s joke, it turned out to be real and I’ve been incredibly excited about it ever since. 

If you don’t know, Amazon Dash is a new product that is essentially a physical button that when pressed, orders a particular item for you. It’s an extension of what they’ve done with [subscription orders](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subscribe-and-save/details/), but now with more control and in real life. 

Initially Dash is just physical buttons that Amazon is giving away, but they’ve also opened up an [API for developers](https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service) so that certain devices with sensors can automatically reorder things for you. Like [this coffee machine (Poppy)](https://poppyhome.com/pour-over) that will reorder beans for you when you’re running low. 

This brings me back to my post about [devices talking to other devices](/2014/09/10/internet-of-things/). It’s great that Amazon is leading the way on this and although Dash has yet to come out, it seems like a really elegant first step towards pushing this to reality. 

Awesome stuff — I’ve ordered one and looking forward to seeing more interesting stuff coming out of this.
