At the end of every year, I always do a review of my principles, accomplishments, failures, and goals for next year. Figured that this year I would share them here.

**To start, some things that I try to live by**:

1. Happiness is fulfillment. Fulfillment is empowerment & positive contribution.
2. Less is focus, focus is depth. 
3. Actions express priorities.
4. Live in the moment.
5. [Money is circulated. Time is spent](http://frankchimero.com/blog/some-lessons-i-learned-in-2013/).
6. Always plan for the long term. 
7. [Pain + Reflection = Progress](http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf).
8. [Leadership is about managing your psychology](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/31/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/).

**Accomplishments**:

1. Built Inventory product & good start to building the business, both upsell and net new.
2. Grew Expenses team & business quite a bit. Next up, stability & international growth. 
3. Took on Mobile (iOS & Android), rebuilt product.
4. Built product functional teams at Coupa across Dev, PM, Support, Services.
5. Got promoted. Hired a PM. 
6. Built Flixus product (side project), dev & content team.
7. Starting to build Minmail (side project). Wrote some code. 
8. Leveraged [Zirtual](https://www.zirtual.com/plans-pricing/?referrer=christopher.e.yin%40gmail.com) to save time.
9. Wrote more on the blog, did [podcast](/2014/10/29/brighteyes/) & a [guest post](/2014/10/01/collaboration/).
10. Invested in & advising [ADI Ventures](http://adiventures.net/). 

**Failures**:

1. Not enough focus on health (exercise & food).
2. Unhealthy time management - binging on one thing for a period of time and completely ignoring others.
3. Too many ongoing zombie projects. 
4. Neglected important people in my life for work.
5. Started but did not finish enough books.
6. Didn't promote my writing enough. Was OK until auto RSS with Mailchimp broke and never fixed it. 

**And here's a few things that I want to do in 2015**	:

1. Lose weight & be healthier overall.
2. Better balance & time management.
3. Build more network.

Looking forward to 2015. If any questions, comments, let me know!
