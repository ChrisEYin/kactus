Recently Foursquare [announced the split](http://blog.foursquare.com/post/87012827988/more-on-swarm-and-the-future-of-foursquare) of their service into 2 different apps, [Foursquare](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foursquare/id306934924?mt=8) and [Swarm](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id870161082?mt=8). The move was to separate the feature they’re largely known for, check-in's (Swarm), from their new focus, reviews & recommendations (Foursquare). 

The move doesn’t come as a surprise, but the launch has been less than spectacular. People have been [pretty vocal](https://medium.com/@dweekly/dear-foursquare-c7c441fdf25e) about their distaste for the service, and downloads are rankings are both down. There’s even a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/killswarmapp) and a [blog](http://killswarmapp.tumblr.com/) dedicated to killing their new app, Swarm. And the press is [questioning their ability to survive](http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/29/as-relaunch-hype-subsides-will-foursquare-survive/). Not looking great. 

While there is risk, I wouldn’t count Foursquare out yet. Dennis has always said the vision is local search and they’re just starting to execute on that now. Over the years they’ve just been collecting the data to power this engine. And if you look at the ratings & reviews, the anger is primarily around the product changes as opposed to a commentary on the service. Those that have used the product for what it’s designed for have had decent things to say.

Outside of the above, a common thread that is brought up is Yelp. Those who say Yelp has already won the local restaurant game aren’t seeing what Foursquare could be. Yelp is in the same space, but the focus & products are different. Yelp is a directory, similar to the yellow pages. Foursquare is a recommendation engine that delivers tips based on your tastes. While Yelp has features that mimic Foursquare’s, the products are inherently different. Not a zero sum game, and they can co-exist. 

All that being said, I do think there is a fair amount of execution risk here. Public perception of Foursquare is not great right now. Plus they’ve raised quite a bit of money & have been around for awhile; their investors may be needing that cash back soon, forcing their hand before it’s ready. 

But I think the real risk is with the product. With their new model of separating check in’s and reviews, they have to more actively craft both sides of this marketplace to keep check-in data coming. Plus they have to make sure people don’t reject the apps post split. Making sure people continue checking in is just as important as people using their reviews serve.

Looking from the outside, I’m not sure I agree with the split. I do believe in unbundling & single purpose apps on mobile, but I think in this case I think they should have kept the products together. Checking in and getting reviews are 2 separate functions, but they’re tied together by location. A user shouldn’t have to think about which app to open when they get somewhere – Foursquare should just aim to be the first app users remember to open when they go anywhere. So they risk the user loss from that split, and also risk neglecting one side for the other, causing more loss. 

But this is all coming from the outside. I have no insight outside of my own speculation, so I could be totally off. Regardless, while there is risk I still think Dennis & team have a lot going for them and I’m still rooting for Foursquare.
