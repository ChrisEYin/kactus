Setup the standing desk yesterday. Pretty cool, cost $35 and took ~30 min to build. Really easy.

Still breaking it in, can only stand for 3-4 hours at at time before my back starts giving out, but will continue working on it.

Would recommend it if you spend most of your day sitting down. If interested, [instructions here](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html) via [Colin of Customer.io](https://twitter.com/alphacolin).
