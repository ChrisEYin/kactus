In conjunction with my [2014 review](/2014/12/31/2014-Review/), I wrote down some general thoughts on what I think 2015 and the future holds for us. Again, thought I'd share here.

In no particular order,

**Enterprise**

Enterprise software will continue to boom and we'll see more companies going public in 2015. The enterprise is really embracing SaaS now, so there's opportunity for new products to take the place of legacy enterprise tools, and still lots of opportunity for larger enterprise software companies to convert laggards. We'll continue to see mobile get emphasized, but I don't think we'll have meaningful movement here in the enterprise yet.

**SMB**

We are going to see a lot more activity in this space as some of the early SMB companies start to get very big ([Styleseat](https://www.styleseat.com/), [Mindbody](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/)). Some of these tools will be mobile/tablet first and will lay the groundwork for how enterprise will take advantage of mobile. I also think that the SMB space will begin to use prosumers very effectively, creating a way to incentivize their best users to become their sales force.

**Vertical**

Some blend in with SMB above, but we'll also see more vertical specific software moving to the mainstream. Companies like [Strava](http://www.strava.com/) are building awesome software for their segment, and we'll see more of these begin to really take off.

**Internet of Everything**

Everything is going to be connected to the web (ie [Vessyl](https://www.myvessyl.com/), [Mellow](http://cookmellow.com/meet-mellow/), [Adidas smart ball](http://micoach.adidas.com/smartball/), [a list here](http://www.slideshare.net/crittercism/50-connected-devices-how-mobile-and-the-internet-of-things-will-affect-you)). We're beginning to discover some really good use cases outside of health, and as the price of these sensors continues to drop, these devices will also become affordable and move into early majority territory.

**Big Data**

Big Data will follow the above. With everything connected, we're going to have more data than we've ever had to analyze, and we will continue to see brilliant people working in this space. I don't believe we'll produce meaningful results this year, but we are setting ourselves up for some great years ahead.

**Voice Technology**

Voice powered technology will take front and center stage. Since voice recognition has really matured, we're seeing new products ([Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/oc/echo/)) that are built on voice as the primary interface. Voice is a proxy for what consumers think of as 'AI', and voice technology is going to be embedded into far more apps than today and we'll see some voice first use cases.

**Glue**

Apps can no longer live in their own world. It's now a requirement for things (hardware/software) to talk to other things. This presents a good opportunity for some type of [glue](https://medium.com/@howardlindzon/pulling-fintech-all-together-bc7e10ca0def) technology to surface to integrate all of our apps and connected devices. 

**On Demand**

The on demand model has really blown up the last few years, and now we have some sizeable players in this space ([Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/), [Homejoy](https://www.homejoy.com/)). We're going to see some consolidation as the number of on demand apps on our phone continues to grow. We'll also see services getting built around the on demand model (insurance for AirBnb hosts, etc).

Anyway, these are some general thoughts for what 2015 holds. Let me know any thoughts / feedback in the comments!
