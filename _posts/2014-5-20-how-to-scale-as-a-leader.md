As a startup guy (most recently of Xpenser, a 3 person startup), I have the habit of trying to do everything. Figure out the long term, short term, and get to work -- regardless of the type of task. It's a lot of fun -- constantly figuring it out, learning new things, and getting stuff done.

Now at Coupa, we've got a much larger team (~200), more customers, and separate functions. [When I joined](http://chrisyin.com/2013/04/17/hello-coupa/), I brought with me the same style of work -- do anything and everything. Not long after, my calendar was quickly booked nonstop 8-8 every single day, I was sleeping minimal hours, working weekends, and [perpetually behind](http://www.chrisyin.com/2013/08/27/pretending-to-work/). I had to make a change.

What I realized was that at Xpenser, I was playing the role of (what I call) 'the hero' -- the one man army. That means being on all sales calls during the day, manning all new visitor chats, answering all support emails/calls and implementing customers. At night, doing designs, marketing, recruiting, and long term planning. And this wasn't just me -- everyone on the team played the same role — we just didn’t have enough resources to *not* do everything.

While this works at a small startup, it’s not scaleable and can’t last forever. Being the hero and being involved in every ground level decision inevitably leads to [exhaustion, burn out and resentment](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-12/how-to-avoid-burnout-marissa-mayer) as the company/workload grows. Eventually you’ll bottleneck and become a hinderance to the team.

What I realized was that as a company is rapidly scaling, 'the hero' must to evolve into a leader. That means abstracting yourself from the day to day, and getting the right people around you.

The role of the leader is to focus on the long term and set the attitude & pace to achieve the goal. The number one priority for the leader is to focus on the people — make sure they have the right tools to do their job and and make sure they feel safe to think for themselves and do what they think is right. You have to learn to not jump in when something is going wrong -- learn to just guide and trust they'll figure it out.

As a startup guy, that's how to scale with a quickly growing company. It's been a challenge so far to do this, takes a good amount of self control -- I still get an itch to jump in and try and just do it myself. But overall, so far I'm working better, smarter, and feeling healthier as well.

Conversely, I don't think it's good to spend all of your time only doing long term work. It can put you out of touch with reality. Knowing the real work is essential, and even taking on small projects yourself once in a while is good.
