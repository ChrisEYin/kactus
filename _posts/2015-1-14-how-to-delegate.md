Following up on a previous post, [On Management](/2015/01/02/on-management/), is another important point -- how to delegate. 

When you've been with a company that has grown from small to large, the lines between what to do yourself vs what to delegate can blur.

At Coupa, we've grown from a 3 person PM team to 18 in the last 2 years. Which means now there's people to pass the work around. 

But it's tough figuring out what to delegate and to what degree. In many cases, it's easier & faster to just do it yourself. However as you grow, it becomes impossible to do everything yourself, and you can find yourself going to the other extreme -- delegating everything.

On one end you have micromanagement, and on the other end you have abdication. Both are sins. So I really liked this matrix presented by [Keith Rabois](http://twitter.com/rabois) to help determine what to delegate.

A clear and easy framework. The question now becomes what to do for the question marks? This is dependent not only on the task, but who you're working with.

How I've handled it -- in the top left, I tend to just set direction, advise, and follow up. For tasks in the bottom right, I've had to play a much more active role, setting the direction, creating the plan, following up, and juggling between doing and actively managing.
