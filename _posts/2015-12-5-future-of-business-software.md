SaaS has redefined the business software landscape. [Salesforce](https://www.google.com/finance?q=crm), [Workday](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:WDAY), [Netsuite](https://www.google.com/finance?q=N), [Zendesk](https://www.google.com/finance?q=zen), [Mindbody](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=928465089682890) etc. all displaced incumbents with best of breed SaaS applications. It’s gone from [being dismissed](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2683815/cloud-computing/larry-ellison-s-cloud-tirade--why-he-s-so-scared.html) to creating dozens of public companies [worth billions of dollars](http://www.bvp.com/blog/state-cloud-2015).

But now these applications must evolve or face the same fate as the former incumbents. A technology shift is coming that will rewrite what much of buisness software is today. 

Fundamentally, cloud computing is still just a database with a UI on top and some basic functionality around it (basic logic, workflow, etc). You can take this data with you anywhere (web & mobile), but you’re still typing in data and running basic queries to extract what you need. A UI to guide you through remote access to a database. 

Let's take Zendesk. Today, customers have to manually type up support tickets when they have issues. And then someone else on the other end has to read them, figure out the answer, respond, etc. You can also report on ticket volumes, check on the go with mobile, etc. But at the end of the day, there's no intelligence behind it. You're just storing data with some semblance of structure so you can report on it or find it later.

And Salesforce. Today, sales people are manually creating opportunities and logging details about them — calls, emails, updates, etc. Again, you can run reports on what is forecasted, pull up opportunity / account info on your phone, etc. But again - manually entering in data and storing it online to deal with it later. 

SaaS systems today still just store information with a UI on top. And they rely on humans to enter in data — which means it’s slow, inefficient, often half complete, and sometimes just plain wrong. 

People are not good at this type of manual work. Posting large amounts of data, trying to analyze it, draw relationships, etc. This is what what machines are good at doing. And so it makes sense that machines will take over for this. 

While this may all sound obvious, historically we haven’t been ready for it. Whether it’s processing power, volume of data, etc — we couldn't do it. But now in an age where most businesses (and people) increasingly rely on computers for everything, the software landscape is going to rewrite itself again.

What if — instead of having customers filing support tickets and having someone on the other end manually reviewing them - [a machine could understand the words in the ticket](https://www.inbenta.com/en) (not just keyword search), investigate the product, and give you the right answer? 

What if instead of entering in details about a call into your CRM, [your phone calls logged themselves and were searchable](https://www.gridspace.com/)? Or even better, the system could understand the phone convo realtime & serve up relevant information you need to push along the deal? 

This is the future we’re looking at in software. No more keying data in, running monthly reports, etc. It will all be about extracting more data from existing assets (images, calls, etc), finding relationships between all of them, and intelligently showing the user what they actually need.

For a primer on this space, [Shivon](twitter.com/shivon) of [Bloomberg Beta](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual) wrote a [great post on it here](https://medium.com/@shivon/the-current-state-of-machine-intelligence-f76c20db2fe1#.dti4wqg69).
