Going back to my original post on how to come up with startup ideas, one of the main things that I talked about was technology advancements. Technology has long been a utility to businesses in order to make more money or save money. And so we must start with that. 

And so when we look at the current state of technology and a bit  of history, historical enterprise software was built on the mainframe. Customers would pay large implementation fees, purchase large deployments of on premise software in order to gain some efficiencies through software. 

This software was much like the web software today, but deployed locally. You could only access it on an internal network, and entire industry was built around this. Consulting firms, security products, server, disaster recovery, automation, etc. And that is the old enterprise software. We saw a number of successful companies come out of this — Oracle, SAP, Siebel, Ariba, HP, Cisco, EMC, etc. You had infrastructure companies, tools, services, applications, etc. 

But then the web was born. We had ASP back in the day, and that was the first iteration of SaaS. Applications back then were essentially databases that were visualized with UI. Then we built some logic into it and so you were able to input some data and then store it in a different format. Maybe workflow, transformation, etc. 

When the web became popular, then we had applications that moved to the web. We rebuilt these old applications into a SaaS infrastructure. There are several advantages of this, but mostly you can now access the data anywhere and reduce the cost of implementing / owning the software. And instead of companies having the ability to customize and bastardize their software, now they have to follow a gold standard. There is one company that is actively learning about everyone’s problems, designing solutions, and deploying them. Most of the customers that we’ve dealt with that could customize their solutions could only think so far because they weren’t technologists. So they would build some nonsense, think about what the business needed instead of what the end user wanted and you ended up bastardizing your software, making it unusable, unmaintanable, etc. 

And so when the web came, we had a new era of software. Not only is this now accessible anywhere, meaning you can have an unprecedented level of access, because now people are focused on   the usability, you can now have an unprecedented level of adoptions. Meaning the power and utility of this software can now be given to everyone. Which is a huge. 

But outside of infrastructure, deployment model, usage, etc - the core applications have really stayed the same when it comes to enterprise software. You have a database and a UI that guidse you to fill in that database. You can build in some basic calculations, workflow, etc - but ultimately this about human beings typing stuff into a computer. 

So companies have been doing this for some time, and it’s all good. The SaaS revolution is here, and applications are now coming online where they weren’t before. So there are still applications that are being built for the enterprise that are interesting where there weren’t applications before. And so that is still an interesting space. You can also say that about mobile. Different industries that didn’t have applications before can now leverage mobile, a computer in everyone’s hands to start to introduce software to stale industries. Which is great stuff. 

However, machines are still doing basic data collection. We have wider access to data and can retrieve it anywhere, but the thinking and analysis is still done at a human level. The next technological trend that is really coming into play is Machine Learning, which is really a proxy for AI. 

And so with all of the SaaS application and tracking of data, we have a few different opportunities in the enterprise. There is still some low hanging fruit in the SaaS space for applications that didn’t exist before. There are still mobile apps that are rethinking particular segments and also introducing to vertical that historically has not had software (people that are not knowledge workers sitting at the desk all day). 

But for other SaaS applications, we now have the opportunity to redo this entire space with machine learning first and data aware applications. With the proliferation of API’s, you can plug into virtually everything out there and there is a ton of data that is at play. In addition with the IoT and drones automating more data capture, you can begin to automate that process as well. So now the computer’s job is to process all of this information and come up with actionable data and advice. And so this is the opportunity that we are looking at. 

The will create a whole new industry and there are several things at play here. As with all industries, you have the tools and you have the applications. The existing applications in each industry will become data aware and smart. So the current incumbents in the space are SFDC, Concur, Coupa, Zendesk, Zuora, Workday, Netsuite, etc. 

The newer guys are going to rebuild these applications thinking about data first and machine larding first. One of these is InBenta. They are
