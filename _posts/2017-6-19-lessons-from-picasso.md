I was in Barcelona a few weeks ago and stopped by the [Picasso museum](http://www.museupicasso.bcn.cat/en/). Despite not knowing much about him (or art), I walked away with a new appreciation for his incredible life & works.

Picasso is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He was incredibly prolific, creating over 45,000 pieces over his lifetime across paintings, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, and more. His works have sold for over a combined $600 Million. 

While walkign through the museum, one section in particular spoke to me -- Picasso’s [Las Meninas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Meninas). It’s his take on a [Diego Valesquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez) painting from 1656 (also called Las Meninas). The [original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Meninas) is considered one of the most important paintings in Western art history (pictured below).

Late in Picasso’s life (when he was 75), he spent time studying & analyzing the original Las Meninas and decided to try his hand. It ended up not being just a single painting, but a collection of 58 different takes. The main piece is pictured below.

I’m not an art expert by any means, so will leave that to more qualified people. But what struck me was the in depth view into the creative process of one of the greatest painters of our time. 

When viewing the collection, there was a temptation to spend most of the time focusing on the main piece. But I found that it was more interesting to view the entire set and [analyze the collection as a whole](http://www.blogmuseupicassobcn.org/2015/08/the-chronology-of-las-meninas-of-picasso/?lang=en). 

Each painting is an exploration of a theme or set of ideas and he was able to encapsulate that viewpoint onto the canvas. Through the progression you can see how his thinking evolves, where he combines / sheds ideas, and ultimately how it all comes together in his final piece. 

It's amazing to see. And a testament to this man's ability to work hard! Producing 58 paintings (each of which could stand on its own) at 75 years old is not trivial. A quote from him:

> If someone want to copy Las Meninas, […] I would say ..what if you put them a little more to the right or left? I'll try to do it my way, forgetting about Velázquez. The test would surely bring me to modify or change the light because of having changed the position of a character. So, little by little, that would be a detestable Meninas for a traditional painter, but would be my Meninas.

A walk down a different hall showcased many of the [portraits he painted of his friends](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/arts/design/picassos-life-portrait-by-portrait.html). In a similar vein, he painted each friend several times, each in a different style. It echoed the same creative process as I saw in Picasso’s Meninas — exploration, iteration, and repetition.

A quick google search led me to a famous Picasso drawing, ‘[The Bull’](http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/animals_in_art/pablo_picasso.htm). It’s a masterclass in simplicitly, iteration, and echoes the same lessons from above. In fact, [Apple uses 'The Bull'](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3034240/how-apple-uses-picasso-to-teach-employees-about-product-design) to teach product design to their employees.

The bull is a set of drawings of a bull. In each iteration he simplifies the bull until finally, several versions later, he has stripped away everything unnecessary and just left the purest essence of a bull. See below.

It's a beautiful example of simplicity, iteration, and working to truly understanding the essence of something.

I’ve long considered building products, teams, and companies as an art. And Picasso teaches us how great works of art are made. It's about combining ideas, new viewpoints on old things, simplification, and hard work / iteration to really build something beautiful & long lasting. 

To end, here's one of my favorite quotes from him:
