As I’m sitting down to do my 2016 review, I look back at my blog   over the last 3 years and think about why I’m even doing this. I’ve been asked by several people what I get out of it, so I figured I would write it down here.

First off, a bit of a review. Some numbers:

* 20 posts in 2015
* 33 posts in 2014
* 21 posts in 2013

The topics:

* General thoughts & predictions
* My learnings from startup
* Product Reviews
* Book Reviews
* Personal Stuff

Most popular: 

* [Collboration 3.0](/2014/10/01/collaboration/)
* [Working Hard & Not Getting Anything Done](/2013/08/27/pretending-to-work/)
* [The Next Wave of Business Software](/2015/12/09/future-of-business-software/)
* [Minimum Viable Product](/2014/08/18/mvp/)
* [Are You Learning To Fail or Failing To Learn?](/2013/05/23/learning-to-fail/)
* [To Improve Your Work, Stop Working](/2013/08/01/sharpening-the-saw/)

Now when I look at what I [wrote about writing almost 3 years ago](/2013/03/12/writing/), this stuck out to me: 

> The goal was to gain insight about my ideas, learn, and get better at writing.

As I fast forward to today, not much has changed about this. So to refresh & expand a bit more on why I write: 

__To help refine my thoughts__

For me, writing is another way of thinking. It helps crystallize my own thoughts & opinions and clears out the garbage. Putting this in public on the web forces me to at least think through some things I write about so I don’t sound like too much of an idiot.

__To share__

I’ve learned a lot of things over the last couple of things. Some good, some bad. While I think that [generalized advice is usually not very helpful](/2014/09/02/advice/), if there’s even 1 person going through something similar and my experiences can help them (or just allow them to relate), then it’s all worth it.

__To get better at writing__

Writing is a huge part of my life. Whether’s it’s emails, product specs, presentations, etc - writing things out in a clear & concise manner is one of the main forms of communication in my life. So I’d like to think that by consistently writing, I”m getting somewhat better at it.

__To leave a memory__

Writing in public on the web helps preserve my thoughts and also carves out a place for me on the web. I spend so much time on the web, it’s nice to have my own digital home.
