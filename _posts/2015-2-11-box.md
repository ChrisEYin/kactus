[Box](http://www.box.com) is an enterprise software company that recently [went public](http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/23/investing/box-ipo-tech-stocks/). They make and sell cloud based collaboration software, most notably around filesharing.

Amidst their public offering, I read [a lot](http://www.businessinsider.com/box-ipo-analysis-2014-3) of [pessimistic articles](http://pando.com/2015/01/09/ipo-of-last-resort-box-has-no-choice-but-to-go-pubic-despite-its-ugly-numbers/), primarily about Box’s 'fundamentally flawed business'. The most prominent critique is that Box spends too much money to acquire their revenue -- the equivalent of spending $1.79 to get $1 ([S-1 here](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1372612/000119312514112417/d642425ds1.htm)). Therefore, at some point it will all collapse when they run out of money.

This made very little sense to me. As [I wrote](http://www.chrisyin.com/2014/07/09/lets-stop-saying-b2b/) [about earlier](http://www.chrisyin.com/2013/12/21/freemium-doesn%27t-always-work-in-b2b/), I’m not sure that reporters understand much about enterprise software. While Box may be spending $1.79 to get $1 in revenue, that does not make the business unsound.

[SaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) companies are based on [LTV, lifetime value of the customer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value). Customers buy software, and then they pay an annual subscription to keep using it. So the LTV of each customer = (contract price) * (contract length).

On the other end, there’s [CAC, cost of customer acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_cost). This metric is how much was spent to acquire that customer (sales, marketing, services, support, etc). In order to have a real business, LTV must be greater than CAC.

So when reporters say Box spent $1.79 to acquire $1 in revenue, they aren’t wrong. But the $1 is not the LTV. It’s first year revenue. We need the LTV to properly measure the business, and in order to get that, we need to see some churn. And with Box touting [100%+ retention rate](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1372612/000119312514112417/d642425ds1.htm) (adds on attribute to the greater than 100%), we don't have enough churn to calculate a meaningful average LTV.

The beauty of SaaS is that after year 1 cost drops significantly (greater than 0, still have to support), but revenue continues to go up. Let’s say support costs $0.25 going forward. In year 2, they’ve now spent $2 to acquire $2. In the 3rd year they've become profitable at $2.25 for $3, and it keeps going from there. [Jason Lemkin](https://twitter.com/jasonlk) of [SaaStr](http://saastr.com/) sums it up well [here](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/17/box-will-hit-1-billion-in-revenues-before-you-know-it/).

We can even get more nuanced and segment LTV by customer size. Larger customers cost more, but churn less — and the inverse for smaller clients. Therefore, having a CAC > LTV on small deals may still be ok as long as it's covered by having a greater LTV > CAC on larger deals. 

And although Box has a lot of small clients ([average ACV < $5k](http://tomtunguz.com/box-ipo/)), Box is clearly moving towards large enterprise deals, with 57% of last year's deals at over 1,000 seats and more recently, [GE](http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/08/box-scores-huge-win-with-ge/) with 300k users and [Astrazeneca](http://recode.net/2015/01/27/after-ipo-box-lands-astrazeneca-deal/) with 51k users. And bigger deals typically have longer horizons and churn much less.

Regardless, we can’t tell yet if it’s a fundamentally flawed business. We'll have to wait until customers start churning so we can begin to measure average LTV. And with 100+% renewals, bigger enterprise deals, the math looks like it'll work itself out before we see any significant churn.
