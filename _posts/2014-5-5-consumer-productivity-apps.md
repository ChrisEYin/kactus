People don't like paying for software. Despite being incredibly cheap relative to how much value it provides, most people still gawk at the idea of paying for a $.99 app (or any software). Why? 

I was thinking about this after reading Hunter Walk's recent post, ['Why won't consumers pay for productivity apps?'](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/04/24/why-wont-consumers-pay-for-productivity-apps/). His point -- consumer productivity software might fare better if they exposed metrics about the value they were providing -- ie. how much time they saved you, how many emails they sent for you, etc.

I was shocked to see most commenters either agreeing or pointing to other examples of productivity software that smartly did this. While they weren't wrong -- it probably would be helpful if productivity software promoted their metrics more -- they were all missing the point entirely.

The point is that consumers not only don't care about productivity, they also value money > time. 

When we look at the average consumer's behavior, they're not focused on productivity. Consumers either are either home after a long day at work or they're hanging out with friends on the weekend. They're thinking about relaxing, taking it easy, and enjoying themselves. Productivity is not a high priority for the consumer (I wrote about solving [the right priorities here](http://www.chrisyin.com/2013/12/21/freemium-doesn%27t-always-work-in-b2b/)). That's why you see most successful consumer applications geared towards leisure -- Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, etc. Productivity doesn't fit here.

Also, the average consumer values money much more than their own time. Since there are no explicit tasks/agenda for them, they value their own time at $0.00. So many things are more valuable than their time (esp. money). So trying to monetize consumer productivity is an uphill battle --  also why popular consumer apps are free and ad supported as opposed to subscription based.

All productivity software either starts as pure B2B or eventually leans and focuses on the B2B market. Because the product matches the buyers intent, that's where the money is.

As a footnote, I'll say that I do think that as time goes on, we'll have an increase in the number of consumers that value time > money and are willing to pay for software. But we still have a long way to go, and I'm unsure if this will ever be the predominant consumer mentality -- I simply believe that this consumer group is increasing in size.
