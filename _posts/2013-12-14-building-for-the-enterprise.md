A little over a year ago, I joined [Xpenser](http://tcrn.ch/18MuCue) -- a startup building expense management tools for businesses and individuals. We were 4 years old, bootstrapped, small (3 full time + interns), ~85K users and ~150 paying customers.  

It was my first time building for businesses. I studied and learned about building product for companies, how to sell, marketing, support, scaling, recruiting, etc. 

About 6 months later, we were acquired by [Coupa](http://tcrn.ch/18Muzyn), a spend management company, to help run & build upon their existing expense management business.

After we started at Coupa, I thought I'd be doing the same thing I was doing at Xpenser, but just at a different company. The setting would be different, but the goals were the same -- build the best expense management solution for the businesses. At the time we joined, Coupa was 6 years old, had raised ~$50M in venture capital, ~150 people, and 400+ paying customers.

I was wrong. Even though both times we were solving the same problem & selling to companies, the lessons I learned didn't apply universally. At Xpenser we were selling to businesses; at Coupa, we were selling to the enterprise.

As a student of the startup game, both times (at Xpenser & Coupa) I went to the web to learn from founders/entrepreneurs. Both times I found little helpful information, and in many cases, what I did find turned out to just be plain wrong.

The majority of startup advice I found on the web was directed at consumer startups. And that made sense -- for a startup whose customers are other businesses, you don't want to keep gushing your mistakes in a public forum. That kind of information will kill you in a sale. Opacity and boilerplate press releases were safer than honest blog posts.

So it's hard to find good information on the web for startups to learn about building for businesses. For what I did find -- there seemed to be a general misconception -- B2B does not always mean enterprise. There is some gray area, but for the most part, there is a distinction between building for businesses and buidling for the enterprise. There are difference, and those differences should shape your strategy.

After serving and building for all types of businesses at both Xpenser & Coupa, I've learned a bit about the space, and I'll be sharing what I've learned here. [Click here to subscribe](http://eepurl.com/DdF7n)!
