Opening files via Finder was beginning to be a pain in the ass, so figured I should do it via the command line. 

Quick search online yielded a bunch of results -- most did not work for some reason. 

After breaking my bash profile and spending a ton of time going through a bunch of options, eventually found something that did work (below). Thought I'd share to save anyone else the trouble.

```
cd
vim .bash_profile
# add below to your bash profile
alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"
$ source .bash_profile
$ subl --help
```
