Throughout most of my life, I’ve tried to work hard, do what I think is right, and constantly improve. I’ve found that this works for me, and helps me advance in life. 

However, there have been a few times where I’ve been in an environment that made me not want to work hard. I felt the team was not performing to my standard, I was being weighed down, and ultimately, I was carrying the team. I felt like I was wasting my time and that I should stop trying so hard — simply match the team’s standard, and focus my energy elsewhere.

I’ve looked back and realized that the above is a really negative way to think and approach work. If you spend all day doing something where you only hope to barely make it by, why even do it? Life is too short to waste your time trying to dial it in, and if you feel yourself going that way, you should probably think about leaving.

What has been helpful to me in these situations is focus on my standard and lead. Regardless of the team’s output, I focus on working to my standard. I don’t care what anyone else does, I do what I think is right and produce what I would expect out of myself.

The result is 2 fold. One on hand, it’s incredibly liberating to work this way. Regardless of anything else, I can be proud of my own work and feel good about what I did. Also, working to my own standard gets me out of the petty mind state of comparing each piece of work I do to someone else’s, and it elevates my overall level of thinking.

The second thing is that by performing to your own standard, you now have an opportunity to lead. When you constantly put out high quality work, people notice. You can lead by example and show them how to put out high quality work, why it matters, and elevate the entire team. You’ll earn respect, increase the output of your team, and in the long term, get rid of the negativity and take the load off youself.
