Finding good products is hard. I remember trying to pick a CRM system at Xpenser. I spent a ton of time searching the web, reading articles/blogs, on the phone with sales people, playing with free trials, etc. It was not easy to figure out which product was best for us -- it all (various marketing & sales people) sounded the same.

This problem of choosing the right product is prevalent across all businesses. There still isn't a good way to efficiently map a company's problem to a solution. The enterprise is littered with stories of companies spending tens of millions internally or with consultants / research firms to evaluate / buy / implement systems. And then never using them. SMB's typically navigate a crowded landscape alone leading to wasted time and often misguided purchases. 

The most effective way to convert is still word of mouth / recommendations. This way the 'seller' is knowledgeable on the problem, the product, solution, etc and is trusted. So in this case the buyer & seller are truly aligned around solving a particular problem. 

But finding a trusted recommendation is not always easy. In the absence of this, the buyer defaults back to a company's sales & marketing efforts - which are not the best guides. 

So if we can further incentivize power users to recommend products and allow them to easily scale, it's a win-win-win. Power users pocket extra money for recommending products they know & love. Buyers spend less time evaluating solutions and end up with products that actually solve their problems. And companies can more effectively distribute their products.

The internet gives us this ability. The web allows individuals to build large audiences by creating valuable content (see stars on [Instagram](http://www.elle.com/culture/tech/news/a28322/instagram-all-stars-trending-ny/), [Twitter](http://www.fastcompany.com/3036880/how-to-make-500000-a-year-on-twitter), [Youtube](http://www.tvguide.com/galleries/youtube-stars-make-more-1089689/), [Snapchat](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/rising-snapchat-stars-earn-100000-per-week/201806), [etc](https://gigaom.com/2013/10/05/rise-of-the-prosumer-analyst-how-mobile-is-driving-a-new-brand-of-business-analysis/)). So companies need to leverage this same model and build the tools & incentives for their power users to take recommending their products even further. 

If we extrapolate, we can imagine how this can potentially revolutionize how sales as a whole is done today. The old model of hiring a bunch of sales people to knock down doors is inefficient and feels very archaic. By leveraging your community of users, good products will have a built in, knowledgeable and effective sales force. And if we extrapolate even further, we can imagine how companies could use the real time nature of the web to leverage their best users in other departments -- services, support, and more.

As a side note, large companies often hire expensive consultants to be their trusted 3rd party. They'll leverage expensive research firms (also supposedly trusted 3rd parties) to evaluate and make decisions. While this works in some cases, it clearly doensn't work all the time -- otherwise there would be no horror stories in the enterprise. In the model above, we may see dedicated individuals create new age consulting / research firms to disrupt the large consulting firms of today.

In my [2015 predictions post](http://www.chrisyin.com/2015/01/05/2015-predictions/), I wrote that:

> "I also think that the SMB space will begin to use prosumers very effectively, creating a way to incentivize their best users to become their sales force."

So I was excited to see [Growsumo](http://growsumo.com/) come out of the latest YC batch. Really looking forward to see what they do.
