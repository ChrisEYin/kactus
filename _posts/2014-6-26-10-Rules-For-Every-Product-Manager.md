I've had a lot of people ask me what a PM is or does. Everyone has their own definition but here's my take.

The job of the PM is to create scaleable revenue via product. This means always being in sync with both the macro and the micro -- from business opportunity, risks, competition -- to which features to build, active deals, risk customers, etc. 

The job is to then synthesize all of that information and turn it into a roadmap. And a roadmap isn't just a list of features to build. It's a plan on how to build a scaleable and profitable business around a product. This means owning the entire product -- development, distribution, and maintenance.

To do this, the PM needs to not only enable other teams (development, ops, sales, services, support, marketing) in the organization to succeed, but they need to deeply understand how each team functions -- what's working and what's broken -- what to fix now and what can wait. 

And lastly, the PM's job is to take all of blame and none of the credit. It's to be the leader, the backbone, and the glue of the organization. Anything short of this is failure.

In a bit more detail -- --

**1. Own The Vision**

Find it ruthlessly by living in the future, and constantly reassess it against the current state of things. Set aside time regularly to think about this.

**2. Understand Reality**

While you need to dream up a grand vision, you also have to keep your eyes on the road at the same time.

*'Vision without execution is hallucination.'*

**3. Communicate**

You can't achieve greatness alone. There's always a team involved, and make sure everyone understands where they're going, how, and why. Dont' be afraid to constantly repeat yourself. 

**4. Prioritize Ruthlessly**

There are endless things you can get pulled in -- dev, sales, support, services -- but there's only 24 hours a day -- where is your time best spent? Make sure every minute you spend working has the highest impact. 

A good way to think about this is -- (Value created) / (time spent).

**5. Own The Product**

You should know the in's and out's of your product. Know the short term, long term, any debt you're building up, quick wins, gamechangers, experiments, etc. 

**6. Own Distribution**

Sales/Marketing is not someone else's problem. It's yours. Make sure your messaging is right, people can find your product, use it, extract real value, and then tell others about it. 

**7. Own Support**

Regardless what business you're in, you need users/customers. In almost all cases, the more the better (for us in SaaS, you live and die by LTV). High churn will kill you just as fast as a lack of sales. Great support keeps your users/customers with you.

**8. Always Be Learning**

You're going to make mistakes. That's fine. What's not fine is repeating those mistakes. You must constantly be evaluating the outcome -- what worked, what didn't work and learn from it. 

**9. Don't Let Competition Distract**

Keep your ears open on competitors, but don't let them affect your plans. This takes a tremendous amount of discipline. Practice it.

**10. Always Be Recruiting** 

Resourcing is your problem, not HR's. If you can't sell the opportunity to somebody, you've got bigger problems.

<hr>

All of this above can seem like a lot to take in, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. The job of the PM is to understand all of this, prioritize, and balance their time and energy across all of these things. It's not easy, but ultimately it's incredibly rewarding. Hopefully that helps!
