I’m a strong believer that management should always be promoted from within. When it’s time, the best person in that respective discipline should be promoted into leadership. 

A number of reasons why, but this way you energize the team instead of risking demoralization, the new manager comes in with built in trust/respect, and more. 

However, there are times when you need to bring in someone from the outside to lead. And when there’s a tight knit team, it’s not easy for a new manager to take charge and lead.

When we’ve had to bring in outside management, I’ve seen it handled a few different ways –

* Dictator – sweep in and start making immediate changes
* Proxy – not a leader, but a proxy for a different boss that didn’t have the time
* Team Member – join as part of the team, working with them
* Ineffectual – Not doing much, except blaming the team for their problems

All of these are risky and potentially destructive except for 'Team Member'. In order to have the smoothest transition, it is imperative to first be a team member & gain the their respect before you do anything. 

First join the team & observe. Provide value, take things off the team’s plate, and fight for the team. Once you have the team's respect & have a good understanding of how they function, only then can you start to take charge and make change. Anything else and you risk demoralization and breaking up the team.
