Much like alcohol prohibition in the 1930’s, cannabis prohibition is coming to an end. This is great for many reasons (decriminalization, freeing up jails, taking power away from organized crime, etc), but it also creates a massive economic opportunity. So wanted to do some research and get a sense of the landscape. 

__A Bit of History__

[Cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Marijuana) has been around for a long time. First appearance dates back to China / Taiwan ~3000 years ago, and it’s [all over several other ancient civilizations’ history books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medical_cannabis) as well. It was used both casually and medicinally until in the early 20th century it began getting criminalized, ultimately getting banned in the US banned with the [Marihuana Tax Act in 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937)). Although still illegal federally, individual states have been easing up on cannabis with Washington becoming the 1st state to legalize in 2012, Colorado soon after, and more. 

__Current__

As mentioned, individual states are currently [easing up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction) on cannabis. To clarify, there are different types of easing up including [medical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis), [decriminalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decriminalization_of_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States), and recreational (fully legal). Currently, there are 4 states - Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington (+ District of Colombia) that have fully legalized, as well as a few individual cities. 18 states have decriminalized, and 25 have medical. Across the rest of the world it still varies quite a bit. 

If we look ahead -- a leading marijuana group, [The ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/), predicts that by 2020 [18 states will have fully legalized marijuana](http://www.hightimes.com/read/18-states-predicted-legalize-weed-2020). A 2015 Gallup poll shows that for the 3rd year in a row, the majority ([58% of American citizens](http://www.gallup.com/poll/186260/back-legal-marijuana.aspx), and [68% of millenials](http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/marijuana/international-statistics.html)) think that it should be legalized. So still a ways to go, but it seems as if full legalization is on its way. Below is a map of [marijuana's legal status across the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_country).

__Usage__

People like marijuana. It’s the most commonly used drug in the US with [22.2 million monthly users in 2014](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-scope-marijuana-use-in-united-states) (~7% US population). Another study shows that in 2013 between [128 and 232 million people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Skunk) used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). For reference, about [16.8% of the US population in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption) used tobacco. Given the current legal status of marijuana, a lot of people use marijuana and this will only increase once it's more broadly legal.

__Market Size__

In an annual report the [ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/) publishes, [legal marijuana sales](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/business/legal-marijuana-sales-2015-report.html?_r=0) hit $5.4 Billion in 2015, up from $4.6 Billion in 2014. The report also predicts 2016 sales will rise to $6.7 Billion, and that it will reach $22 Billion by 2020. 

It's hard to measure a global market size for how much people are spending on marijuana collectively. In 2015, [Havocscope estimated](http://www.havocscope.com/global-marijuana-market-value-and-users/) that global marijuana trade is valued at $141.8 Billion with 164 million worldwide users. Time will ultimately tell, but cannabis is undoubtedly an enormous multi billion dollar market.

__A Bit of History__

[Cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Marijuana) has been around for a long time.

__Legalization — Looking Ahead__

[The ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/) (a leading marijuana group) [predicts that 18 states will have fully legalized marijuana](http://www.hightimes.com/read/18-states-predicted-legalize-weed-2020) by 2020. [Ackrell Capital](http://www.ackrell.com/#about) recently [published a report](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/549b3ffae4b06f75a6e748bd/t/56cd718b1d07c05967a1caf2/1456304532096/Ackrell+Capital+US+Cannabis+Investment+Report+2016.pdf) predicting the end of prohibition entirely by 2020.

Clearly a few different opinions on what the future looks like for cannabis — but given that 39 states already allow some form of legal / medicinal cannabis and with the majority of American citizens in support of legalization ([58% via a 2015 Gallup Poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/186260/back-legal-marijuana.aspx)), it seems like an inevitability.

Even with states legalization, the end of prohibition is really about federal policy, and that is dependent on our next president. The leading candidates as of now are all against recreational, but there is support in moving cannabis to CSA 2, allowing medical. So thing are at least moving in the right direction.

My view is that it may take a bit longer than 2020 for us to fully legalize, but several states will have legalized by then (with California being the first), and we’ll have some more clarity on when prohibition will really be over.

__Usage__

People like marijuana. It’s the most commonly used drug in the US with [22.2 million monthly users in 2014](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-scope-marijuana-use-in-united-states) (~7% US population). Another study shows that in 2013 between [128 and 232 million people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Skunk) used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). 

For reference, about [16.8% of the US population in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption) used tobacco, or 45 million users. So there’s a lot of cannabis users already.

With the onset of more states legalizing, can we expect an increase in usage? If we look at [Coloardo, cannabis usage](https://www.coloradopotguide.com/media/2987/2015-hidta.pdf) has gone up since legalization in 2013. For age groups over 18, there has been an average ~20% increase in last month users. However, tourism dollars have also gone up around ~23% on average since legalization. Not saying these are related, but there may be some overlap.

![usage](/images/alc_usage.png)

If we look back and use alcohol consumption post prohibition as an proxy, [total alcohol consumption in the US definitely increased](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance102/CONS13.htm) after prohibition (graph to the left). It’s not a 1:1 analogy, but it gives us some indication.

My take is that usage will definitely increase, but overal several years and a material increase in usage will come with a new generation new burdened by stigma.

__Market Size__

In an annual report the [ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/) publishes, [legal marijuana sales](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/business/legal-marijuana-sales-2015-report.html?_r=0) hit $5.4 Billion in 2015, up from $4.6 Billion in 2014. The report also predicts 2016 sales will rise to $6.7 Billion, and that it will reach $22 Billion by 2020.

[Ackrell](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/549b3ffae4b06f75a6e748bd/t/56cd718b1d07c05967a1caf2/1456304532096/Ackrell+Capital+US+Cannabis+Investment+Report+2016.pdf) is estimating a $9.5 Billion market by 2019, and a $37 Billion market 5 years after it becomes federally legal. Overall, they’re predicting a global $100 Billion market.

![market](/images/cann_market.png)

It’s hard to measure a global market size for how much people are spending on marijuana collectively but [Havocscope estimated](http://www.havocscope.com/global-marijuana-market-value-and-users/) that the global marijuana trade in 2005 was valued at $141.8 Billion with 164 million worldwide users.

Time will ultimately tell, but given the current numbers (with only a limited number of states legalized), both recreational & medicinal cannabis is undboutedly a massive multi-billion dollar industry that is continually growing.

__Investment__

Investors are seeing the opportunity and the number of firms, investments, and total dollars allocated to marijuana is increasing. [CB Insights recently published some numbers on this](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/cannabis-funding-2015/), showing 98 cannabis deals in 2015, up from 63 in 2014. If you have CB Insights access, they have quarter by quarter [deal data here](https://www.cbinsights.com/industry?public_list&setup=6&subindustry=42521&topsearch_doc_type=company-lists&topsearch_id=42521&topsearch_q=cannabis#activity-pane).

![cannabis-deals](https://cbi-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cannabis-Funding-Trends-2.26.2016.png)

<<<<<<< HEAD
In my research I found 21 investors, including 2 accelerators (full list below). One of the largest was Privateer Holdings, who recently raised [$75 Million from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/06/they-should-have-announced-at-420/)). A few others include [Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com/) founder Justin Hartfield's [Emerald Ocean](http://emeraldocean.com/), [High Times Growth Fund](http://www.hightimesgrowthfund.com/), investor group [ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/investors), [PharmaCan Capital](http://pharmacancapital.com/), and of course - Snoop Dogg's [Casa Verde Capital](http://www.casaverdecapital.com/).

A total of $224.3 Million was invested into cannabis in 2015, up from $111.34 Million in 2014. The bulk of investment is in production companies like [PharmaCannis](http://pharmacannis.com/) & [Leafline Labs](http://leaflinelabs.com/). Emerging are some interesting software companies such as seed to sale companies like [MJ Freeway](http://www.mjfreeway.com/) & [BiotrackTHC](https://www.biotrackthc, .com/) and consumer solutions like [Eaze](https://www.eazeup.com/). 

Despite the increased investment, cannabis deals still make up just a [tiny portion of the investment landscape](http://mjbizdaily.com/chart-of-the-week-2014-investments-in-marijuana-companies-vs-other-industries/). Private equity deals by U.S. firms in 2014 were $48.3 billion last year, software companies raised $19.8 billion and internet companies raised $11.9 billion.

Despite increased investment, still a relatively [small amount of money flowing into this space](http://mjbizdaily.com/chart-of-the-week-2014-investments-in-marijuana-companies-vs-other-industries/). Private equity deals by U.S. firms in 2014 were $48.3 billion last year, software companies raised $19.8 billion and internet companies raised $11.9 billion.

Short descriptions of each area below.

*Infrastructure*  
<<<<<<< HEAD
Equipment / setup - make & sell equipment to produce marijuana. Includes greenhouse, setup, grow lights, nutrients, pest management, drying, water filtration, and software.   
Labs - analyze the end product (cannabis, concentrates, baked goods, etc) and certify the quality.  
Packaging - containers, bottles, child safe bags, etc.  
Real Estate - acquiring space to grow/produce cannabis and/or retail.   
Banking / Payments - banks that accept cannabis money and blockchain enabled payment services.  
Business Services / Other - some interesting ones here, including an audit scoring software service, insurance, ad network, etc.  

*Production*  
Crop Production - growing, cultivating, and producing cannabis. Both recreational & medical.  
Pharmaceutical - alternative medicine utilizing the cannabis plant.  
Baked Goods - self explanatory. Chocolates, cookies, candy, etc.  

*Retail*  
Dispensary Management - software to help you run a dispensary including POS, inventory, online menus, etc.  
Analytics - an interesting segment built to help understand customer behavior and optimize the strains in stock.  
Doctor Verification - services to help either get you a prescription or verify an existing one.  

*Consumer*  
Discovery - help you find strains andn dispensiares a la Yelp.  
On Demand - Uber for cannabis. Lots of activity here. Very regional.  
Ecommerce - online stores for accessories like pipes, wraps, etc.  
Social - posting about marijuana with friends.  
Content - both industry publications as well as consumer.  
Hardware - mostly different vaporizer companies.  

*Multiple - a few companies spanned both production and retail*  
Marketplaces - connecting wholesale growers to dispensaries.  
Seed to Sale - software that helps track cannabis from production all the way to sale. Includes production, growth, inventory, POS, storefront, etc. A lot of activity here.  
End to end - mainly medical companies. Vertically integrated companies that grow, cultivate, and distribute cannabis on their own.

Will do a follow-up post (follow me [@chriseyin](https://twitter.com/chriseyin) or [sign up](http://chrisyin.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6376082d409b23c86890950e4&id=eaeb859075) to get updates!) on what I think is interesting, but some quick thoughts —

* Early days for infrastructure and we’ll a lot of new companies start and get funded here. I’m particularly interested in business services.  
* Production / retail are going to start seeing some early winners emerge in seed to sale software (Flowhub, Headset, etc) end to end and crop production. When prohibition is at its end, there will be some consolidation. I’m into these wholesaler/retail marketplaces.
* The consumer side is going to attract a lot of attention and funding. Will bee too much money / activity in on demand (I would be on Eaze). I’m interested in ecommerce and media.
