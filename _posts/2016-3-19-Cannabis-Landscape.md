Much like alcohol prohibition in the 1930’s, cannabis prohibition is coming to an end. This is great for many reasons (decriminalization, freeing up jails, taking power away from organized crime, etc), but it also creates a massive economic opportunity. So wanted to do some research and get a sense of the landscape. 

__A Bit of History__

[Cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Marijuana) has been around for a long time. First appearance dates back to China / Taiwan ~3000 years ago, and it’s [all over several other ancient civilizations’ history books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medical_cannabis) as well. It was used both casually and medicinally until in the early 20th century it began getting criminalized, ultimately getting banned in the US banned with the [Marihuana Tax Act in 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937)). Although still illegal federally, individual states have been easing up on cannabis with Washington becoming the 1st state to legalize in 2012, Colorado soon after, and more. 

__Current__

As mentioned, individual states are currently [easing up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction) on cannabis. To clarify, there are different types of easing up including [medical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis), [decriminalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decriminalization_of_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States), and recreational (fully legal). Currently, there are 4 states - Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington (+ District of Colombia) that have fully legalized, as well as a few individual cities. 18 states have decriminalized, and 25 have medical. Across the rest of the world it still varies quite a bit. 

If we look ahead -- a leading marijuana group, [The ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/), predicts that by 2020 [18 states will have fully legalized marijuana](http://www.hightimes.com/read/18-states-predicted-legalize-weed-2020). A 2015 Gallup poll shows that for the 3rd year in a row, the majority ([58% of American citizens](http://www.gallup.com/poll/186260/back-legal-marijuana.aspx), and [68% of millenials](http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/marijuana/international-statistics.html)) think that it should be legalized. So still a ways to go, but it seems as if full legalization is on its way. Below is a map of [marijuana's legal status across the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_country).

__Usage__

People like marijuana. It’s the most commonly used drug in the US with [22.2 million monthly users in 2014](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-scope-marijuana-use-in-united-states) (~7% US population). Another study shows that in 2013 between [128 and 232 million people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Skunk) used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). For reference, about [16.8% of the US population in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_consumption) used tobacco. Given the current legal status of marijuana, a lot of people use marijuana and this will only increase once it's more broadly legal.

__Market Size__

In an annual report the [ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/) publishes, [legal marijuana sales](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/business/legal-marijuana-sales-2015-report.html?_r=0) hit $5.4 Billion in 2015, up from $4.6 Billion in 2014. The report also predicts 2016 sales will rise to $6.7 Billion, and that it will reach $22 Billion by 2020. 

It's hard to measure a global market size for how much people are spending on marijuana collectively. In 2015, [Havocscope estimated](http://www.havocscope.com/global-marijuana-market-value-and-users/) that global marijuana trade is valued at $141.8 Billion with 164 million worldwide users. Time will ultimately tell, but cannabis is undoubtedly an enormous multi billion dollar market.

__Investment__

Investors are seeing the opportunity and the number of firms, investments, and total dollars allocated to marijuana is increasing. [CB Insights recently published some numbers on this](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/cannabis-funding-2015/), showing 98 cannabis deals in 2015, up from 63 in 2014. If you have CB Insights access, they have quarter by quarter [deal data here](https://www.cbinsights.com/industry?public_list&setup=6&subindustry=42521&topsearch_doc_type=company-lists&topsearch_id=42521&topsearch_q=cannabis#activity-pane).

![cannabis-deals](https://cbi-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cannabis-Funding-Trends-2.26.2016.png)

In my research I found 21 investors, including 2 accelerators (full list below). One of the largest was Privateer Holdings, who recently raised [$75 Million from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/06/they-should-have-announced-at-420/)). A few others include [Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com/) founder Justin Hartfield's [Emerald Ocean](http://emeraldocean.com/), [High Times Growth Fund](http://www.hightimesgrowthfund.com/), investor group [ArcView Group](https://arcviewgroup.com/investors), [PharmaCan Capital](http://pharmacancapital.com/), and of course - Snoop Dogg's [Casa Verde Capital](http://www.casaverdecapital.com/).

A total of $224.3 Million was invested into cannabis in 2015, up from $111.34 Million in 2014. The bulk of investment is in production companies like [PharmaCannis](http://pharmacannis.com/) & [Leafline Labs](http://leaflinelabs.com/). Emerging are some interesting software companies such as seed to sale companies like [MJ Freeway](http://www.mjfreeway.com/) & [BiotrackTHC](https://www.biotrackthc, .com/) and consumer solutions like [Eaze](https://www.eazeup.com/). 

Despite the increased investment, cannabis deals still make up just a [tiny portion of the investment landscape](http://mjbizdaily.com/chart-of-the-week-2014-investments-in-marijuana-companies-vs-other-industries/). Private equity deals by U.S. firms in 2014 were $48.3 billion last year, software companies raised $19.8 billion and internet companies raised $11.9 billion.
