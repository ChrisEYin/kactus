[David Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch) has been described as ‘the most important director of this era’. He’s created award winning movies & shows like [Blue Velvet](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_velvet/), [Mulholland Drive](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mulholland_dr/), [Inland Empire,](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inland_empire/), [Twin Peaks](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/twin_peaks) and more. He’s not only a celebrated producer & director, but also a recognized painter, musician, designer and writer. 

I recently picked up and read through David’s book [Catching the Big Fish](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0024NP55G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) on creativity, transcendental meditation, and a variety of other topics.  The book is a collection of dozens of short articles written about various topics. Some of my favorite passages:

> “Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.” 
<br>

> “If you want to get one hour of good painting in, you have to have four hours of uninterrupted time.”

> “You don’t dive for specific solutions; you dive to enliven that ocean of consciousness. Then your intuition grows and you have a way of solving those problems.”

> “If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really.”

> “It’s good for the artist to understand conflict and stress. Those things can give you ideas. But I guarantee you, if you have enough stress, you won’t be able to create.  You can understand conflict, but you don’t have to live in it.”

> “If you’re an artist, you’ve got to know about anger without being restricted by it. In order to create, you’ve got to have energy; you’ve got to have clarity. You’ve got to be able to catch ideas.”
