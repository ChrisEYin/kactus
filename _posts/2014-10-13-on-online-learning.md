I was recently chatting with a friend of mine, [Daniel Kao](http://diplateevo.com/), about online learning -- sites like [Codecademy](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). 

The premise of these [online learning sites (MOOC’s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) is to bring university level content to the world via the web. You can now take a [Stanford CS course online](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101) for free, from anywhere in the world. Awesome. 

I have personally learned a tremendous amount on MOOC’s. But I’m still skeptical of their ability to make a material impact on what we think of today as education.

When MOOC’s came about, like most people, I got super excited and signed up for every interesting class that I saw. And like most people, I signed up for far more courses than I actually completed. [Completion rates for MOOC’s are dismally low](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/10/new-study-low-mooc-completion-rates) and the general population does not yet respect an education from a MOOC.

Traditional education is a lengthy, structured process in which we trade our time & money for the promise of jobs. There are 2 main types of learners – the full time student & the hobbyist learner. The full time student is making a long-term investment to eventually translate classes to a job. The hobbyist learner is doing the same, just on a shorter timeframe – learn immediate skills to get promoted, get a new job, start a side gig, etc.

MOOC’s solve neither problem. For full time students, a certificate of completion from a MOOC is not respected by companies. For the hobbyist learner, these classes are too theoretical and abstract to translate into immediate value.

Until MOOC’s can figure out how to help users more concretely translate time investment to value, they will continue to be treated as an educational supplement at best. Not to mention that online courses don’t yet take into account non-academic learnings of school – social skills, networking, etc. These are equally important, and are a large reason why in-school education is still so valued.

But there are a few new takes of learning that are interesting.

The first is vertical learning as a supplement to traditional education. Dev Bootcamp is a good example -- a focused learning environment centered around a particular segment. You’re able to build a very dependable program to transfer valuable knowledge that directly translates to a job. As the model is further perfected, it can be then scaled through the web. This type of educational facility is geared towards the longer term, full time student.

The second is a short term skills based education. Skills training. Udemy is a good example – it’s a marketplace that allows anyone to create and distribute online courses that users pay for. The open marketplace lets instructors to create courses where value can be immediately realized so people can buy it, learn, and then recommend. Very different from content that originated from an institution -- it's real people teaching things that work. If we look at the [top 10 instructors on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/blog/top-ten-earners-on-udemy/), we can see this with courses like [Excel for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/excel-tutorial/), [How to Create a Demo Video for Your Business](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-create-awesome-demo-videos/), (I ignored dev courses). This is geared for the hobbyist learner, taking classes on the side trying to pick up a new skill or job.

Regardless, all are exciting – and I believe that these companies are pushing us towards a shift in education. Education as we have it today is clearly substandard – it’s largely considered an insurance policy – get an education, and you’ll then get a job afterwards. Yet that's not really the outcome that we're seeing. We need these new companies to rethink education so we can better match what is needed in the workforce with what is taught in school.
