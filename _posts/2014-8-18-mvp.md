Going back to [another post I wrote](http://www.chrisyin.com/2014/08/01/Startup-Assumptions/), the first step that’s important in starting up is thinking through and understanding your assumptions. After you have that, the next step is to then go figure out a way to validate those. Here comes your MVP. 

When we get to this part of the conversation, the next thing I hear is a lot of ‘Now I have to build an app to do X’. There are very few cases where you actually need to build something to prove out an idea. If your MVP involves building something from scratch, you likely don’t understand your assumptions enough. 

Like any product, an MVP is a solution to a problem – a person interacts with a product, and the product does something back for them. The purpose is to quickly test and validate your assumptions – do people have this problem and if so, does my solution actually solve their need? ie – does someone care enough check out my product, and if they do, do they use it again and/or pay?

The MVP is to validate that statement. Whether the solution is the result of a manual effort or done by a machine likely doesn’t matter to the end user. The user only cares about the end result – does this solve my problem?

Building an app or some sort of product is simply automating a solution so it can scale. But you only want to invest time building and automating after your solution has been validated. Prior to proving this out, focus on the shortest path to validating your assumptions – and there are likely enough free tools out there for you to validate without building anything.

A few examples -- [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/). It stated out with a basic idea – products are interesting & people care about them. So Ryan [started out with a newsletter](http://ryanhoover.me/post/69599262875/the-wisdom-of-the-20-minute-startup), curating products and sending emails out to friends – the core thesis there is that people not only care about products, but also he can curate and present interesting ones. After they newsletter took off, Ryan then recruits friends to then build the site. In the consumer world, people express interest and vote with their time & engagement. Validation --> Product.

[Uncover](https://www.uncover.com/) has a similar story, but for business. Their idea is that a big part of retainingn talent is rewarding people - so they build a product to reward employees with cool perks. [In the beginning, they manually enabled perks](http://spencerfry.com/do-things-that-don-t-scale-an-uncover-example) until they really got some wind behind it and then they automated. In business, people vote with dollars. Validate --> Product.

Even for technical founders, this is the right way to validate an idea. Embark on the shortest path to validate your solution - whether it's via a manual process or getting a check pre-product. A mockup is worth a million debates & small, manual validations are better than large unvalidated products.
