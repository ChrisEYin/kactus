Transparency is the startup trend du jour that [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) and others ([Mattermark](http://mattermark.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), etc) are leading the charge on. They’ve publicly posted historically private things like [employee salaries](https://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/), [stock options](https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-open-equity-formula/), [funding terms/process](https://medium.com/@DanielleMorrill/welcome-brad-feld-to-the-mattermark-team-announcing-our-6-5m-series-a-dd9532fc1b39), etc.

As someone who spends a good amount of time in the startup world and from my own experience at a high growth startup in Silicon Valley, I’ve become slightly numb to always hearing everyone talk about how they’re ‘killing it’ or some other startup colloquialism. It’s empty and often a half truth (or sometimes just a flat out lie). That’s why being transparent is so welcome.

At the core, transparency is about trust & respect. Most companies (and people) will only tell you what they want you to hear, not what’s really going on. Authenticity is rare. Half truths and canned responses show a fundamental lack of trust & respect to those that are reading your message. If you don’t respect others, they won’t respect you. And if people don’t respect you, it’s tougher to recruit, sell, support, etc.

So for companies - be transparent. People will respond well. You might get some short term dings when you screw up, but long term you’ll have an easier time building a sustainable business.

I think the obvious next question is how can a company maintain a transparent environment when they’re bigger. Most of the companies mentioned are small startups, and startups can afford to talk about their problems openly. Larger companies are typically on the defensive. So the easy answer is to adopt the principle of ‘less information is better’.

It takes discipline and transparency can evolve and grow with the company. You may not be able to openly share salary information, but you can still be transparent about [what you’re doing](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2012/08/27/10-leaders-who-arent-afraid-to-be-transparent/), [things you’ve screwed up](http://allthingsd.com/20111129/the-apologies-of-zuckerberg-a-retrospective/), or [company culture & values](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664).

The net of it is that transparency is about having an honest and open dialogue with your community (customers, users, employees, etc). If you remember to always put them first and keep them in the know, it’s much easier to remember how to be transparent.
