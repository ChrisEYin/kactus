I find myself explaining this more and more often as friends of mine talk about ideas that they are considering/pursuing.

These conversations inevitably lead to talk about some sort of product. More often than not, what I hear for their version of an MVP is is far too large, focused on the wrong things (features, UI), and most importantly -- built on unvalidated assumptions.

When thinking through ideas, the initial focus should not be product. The focus should be on the problem. Understand the problem deeply and boil it down to its basic principles. What's the core issue, who does it affect, how acute the pain is, what are the current solutions, etc. 

The most important thing during this exercise is not just to understand the problem -- but to also get a deep understanding of your assumptions. Excited founders & startup people tend to speak in absolutes when talking about problems. ie - People can't find good restaurants to eat, people hate using their CRM, etc.

Baked into these problem statements are always several unvalidated assumptions. In the restaurant example above - while it may be true, the assumption is that people actually care enough to do something about it. That may or may not be true -- and if true, is that group of people large enough to justify building a service for? And even further -- in that set of people, who is actually willing to pay for a solution (or is that set large enough to serve ads to)?

Building on top of unvalidated assumptions is risky -- it's easy to spend lots of time building something that nobody wants or can't stand on its own two feet. 

So make sure that before you start talking about a product or an MVP to qualify your problem statement, understand your assumptions, and then go out to validate those assumptions.
