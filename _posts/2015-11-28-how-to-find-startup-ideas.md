I spend a good amount of time with friends and such batting around potential ideas for startups. Many are bad, some are ok, few are good. Even fewer are [good for me to work on](/2015/is-this-idea-for-me/). 

Regardless, here is the framework that I use to come up with potential startup ideas. By no means is the only way to come up with ideas, nor the best way. This is just how I do it. 

For me, coming up ideas falls into one of three buckets — 

* Personal issues
* Software where there wasn’t before
* Technology trends

__Personal Issues__

This is the most obvious way and how a lot of good companies are born. You can take personal frustrations and figure out a better way of doing it. This works for both consumer & enterprise. If enough people have a similar problem, you might be on to something. Arguarbly still the best way -- you have the right motivations, domain knowledge, you are the end user, will likely know some early adopters with same problem, etc. 

__Software Where There Wasn’t Before__

If you subscribe to the notion that [software is eating the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460), you can find opportunity in areas where there wasn’t software before. 

There are more people online now and they’re spending more time online than ever (mobile has just tipped past web usage). So problems that weren’t online before or net new problems can now be solved with software. 

For example, 80% of the US workforce is not in front of a computer. With mobile, now all of these people are online and we can build tools to help them with their jobs ([Keep Trucking](https://keeptruckin.com/), [Invoice2go](https://invoice.2go.com/en-us/), [Jobber](https://getjobber.com/), etc.).

__Technology Trends__

I’m also a believer that new technology creates new categories of companies. SaaS, mobile, hadoop, deep learning, etc. 

So an easy way to stay on top of new ideas and such are just to stay in touch with new technologies. When one one of these take hold, massive businesses can be built on top of these — both applications and tools. 

Take SaaS — this has rewritten virtually ever major enterprise software company (Salesforce, Workday, Netsuite, Coupa, etc), consumer software (Gmail, Netflix, FB, Amazon, Twitter, etc), — on tooling, infrastructure, applications, etc. Mobile is following a similar trajectory. 

So thinking about how new trends can be applied can lead to interesting startup ideas.

So these are the ways that I look for new startup ideas. While these are more tactical, the high level summary of this is very simple - think and live in the future. Then work on bringing that future to reality.
