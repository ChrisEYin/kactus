I was watching [PandoMonthly's Mike Maples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOibQNHyF0) interview the other day, and he mentioned a concept called ‘Hot Teams’. 

A hot team is defined as a team that is exponentially more productive than other teams. This is the essence of good startups, and was thinking about this concept - ie what makes up a hot team?

So after [a bit of](http://www.designthinkingblog.com/http:/www.designthinkingblog.com/tom-kelley-on-ideo-and-effective-innovation/#sthash.J3cmukih.dpuf) [reading around](http://www.basadur.com/insightsresearch/OurThoughtsonCreativityandInnovation/HowDoYouCreateaHotTeam/tabid/115/Default.aspx), I came to this -

A hot team is a group that is defined by the following characteristics:
1. There's a vision that people believe in.
2. Nobody is above any job. 
3. Ideas and truth always win. 
4. Any individual can make a difference. 
5. Temporary brokenness is better than permanent paralysis.

The net of this is this to form a team that fits [Peter Thiel's High Alignment / High Trust](http://25iq.com/2014/07/13/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-peter-thiel/) matrix.

So for those of us that manage teams (especially in a startup), we need remember to always to live by the principles above to win.
