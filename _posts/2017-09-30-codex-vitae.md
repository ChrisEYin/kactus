For the last few years, I’ve spent a good amount of my effort on self improvement — specifically in trying to create a repeatable process around it. I’m a big believer that self improvement is the key to happiness. And so in order to improve yourself, you have to first start with who you are and what you believe in. 

So I started writing down my thoughts & beliefs. I originally got the idea after reading [Ray Dalio’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) original [Principles](https://cldup.com/rrhmdLUQeD.pdf) document a few years back. I thought it was brilliant and decided that I should write out my own thoughts in order to explicitly call out what I believe, to better underestand why I believe those things, and then track changes over time. 

I’ve been maintaining a few private documents over the last few years, mainly one that I’ve called ‘Principles’. It’s really just a compilation of quotes, ideas, and thoughts that I believe are important and should govern my life and decision making process. I’ve used it to help reflect on past decisions / behavior as well as make decisions about the future. 

A few months ago, I ran across Buster’s [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public) and was intrigued with it. It was a more detailed look into his beliefs and thoughts, separated out into several categories. And so I recently took a swing at it and decided to come up with my own.

So in tandem with publishing my ‘Principles’ doc, also going to give a shot to maintaining this codex vitae.
