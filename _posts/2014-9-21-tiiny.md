[Tiiny](http://tiiny.com/) recently came out from [North](http://www.n-o-r-t-h-t-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-i-e-s.com/), [Kevin Rose's](https://twitter.com/kevinrose) new [startup studio](/2014/09/17/startup-studio/).  I’m usually pretty cynical when it comes to these types of consumer apps, but I really liked it. 

The product is very simple -- you can easily share and consume images / looping videos that disappear in 24 hours. It plugs into Twitter, and is displayed in a grid layout.

Good things – the product is beautiful & simple. It's easy to use, you get it right away and the product is well done. Also plugging into Twitter to seed the platform with content was a good idea. 

The app is really light and friendly. Because it’s a mix of images and looping videos, the app comes to life when you open it up. In addition, the grid itself is fantastic, providing a lot of content at once so you can feel like you’re diving into a new world instead of a constrained 1-1 experience.

The really great part is the combination of the grid and the 24 hour photo limit. It gives you a feel and a sense of impermanence and playfulness. The images and looping videos light the grid up, and the 24 hour limit and small images in the grid makes it feel safe and fun to contribute silly stuff.

What I did feel weird about was connecting this all to Twitter. While I get that it seeds the network faster, it feels weird to plug into a public network given the feeling of intimacy I get from teh app. Would like to really see this applied to an address book with a close knit of friends. 

Regardless, thought it was a fun and well done app. We'll see how it fares longer term :).
