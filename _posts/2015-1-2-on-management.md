Like a lot of people, I listened and went through the [How to Start a Startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/) series. It's pretty good, I would recommend you give it a go if you haven't already.

One lecture in particular that stood out to me was [Keith Rabois](http://twitter.com/rabois) on [How To Operate](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec14/). 

Lots of good stuff in there, but a few things I really enjoyed --

* Management should be measured by not only the team's output but also adjacent team's outputs. 

* The manager's job is to be an editor. An analogy is editing a paper -- you cross out things that shouldn't there. Over time, should be crossing out fewer and fewer things.

* 2 types of people, barrels & ammo. Barrels are those that can take an idea from start to finish. They drive the company's velocity. Find your barrels & promote them.

* Promote from within. The best in that discipline gets promoted. This way the team doesn't get demoralized and there is respect. Management can be learned later.

Great stuff, check out the [whole lecture here] (http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec14/).
