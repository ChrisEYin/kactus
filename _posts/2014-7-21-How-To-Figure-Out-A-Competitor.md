When evaluating any opportunity/company/etc, you should always do a competitive analysis. A competitive analysis is an overview of the landscape – what’s the space, who are the players, their strategy, and how are they’re doing. 

This is typically done in a few ways – read about the space in an analyst report (or some general market overview), understand the problem/proposed solution, identify competitors, and then read about them. (I’ll write about each piece in a different post).

To read into competitors, you can run through a few sites to get a good general overview – the company’s Businessweek profile, Crunchbase, AngelList, Wikipedia, etc. To get a more in depth overview, you can read the company’s website, blog, press releases, and product review. Through reading all of this, you can start to get an understanding of the product, the business and strategy.

While helpful, the problem is that this type of public information rarely provides anything unique or enlightening. While you can sort of glean a semblance of a strategy from all of this, it can be tough to figure out what is actually going on at the company. 

A good way to get deeper insight into a company is reading through the company’s career page. The job posts that a company has out are very revealing into what the company is currently focused on. They’re either hiring to fix a problem (weakness) or they’re hiring to invest in that particular area (strategy). 

An extension of this is read into past hires – management team, leadership, old employees & new employees. If you read into their backgrounds, tenure, people who left and new hires, you can get a deeper sense into the dynamics and pace of the company. 

Pairing the people and hiring patterns of a company with press & other company news can give you a deeper understanding and more ammo when trying to understand a company from the outside.
