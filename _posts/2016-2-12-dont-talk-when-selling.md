I spend a good amount of time selling. It can be selling our company to potential hires, our product to customers, our vision to analysts, etc. 

You’re always selling too. It can be selling your work to your boss, your idea to team members, your startup to investors, etc. It doesn’t matter — everyone is always selling.  

Selling is a tricky thing. It’s very unnatural to many of us. It can feel dishonest, self-aggrandizing, or outright lying. But that’s only when you’re doing it wrong. 

The thing I se most people doing wrong when selling is talking. When the conversation starts, they immediately start talking — gushing details about the product / company / vision / etc.

Wrong. Selling is about one thing — mapping a problem to a solution. And it’s surprising how often people try to sell a solution without knowing the problem. 

You may have some idea about some generic problem the opposing party is trying to solve, ie ‘I need a product that can do XYZ’ or ‘I’m looking for a new job’. Not only is that just a guess, but it’s also surface level information. 

The real problem is almost never simple as ‘I need a product that can do XYZ’. The real problem might be that person wants a promotion and they need to do something. Or their job is on the line and they want to prove some results. Once you know that, you can position yourself as solving their real problem and put yourself in a place to succeed.

So next time you’re in front of someone selling something — shut up. Take time to listen and ask questions. Once you figure out what the real problem is, craft your message around that.

As a caveat to the above, I’m not advocating lying to sell something. The point is that once you learn the problem, *if* you can solve it, then go for it. If not, don’t.
