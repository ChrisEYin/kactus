I just finished reading [High Output Management](http://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884), and it’s easily one of the best management books I’ve ever read. Lots of real, tangible advice on how to be a better people manager.

It’s written by [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove), the former CEO of Intel - he was there as 3rd employee up to a publicly traded $20B+ company. During his years there, he wrote this book on what he learned. These are my notes.

<hr>

Several concepts in the book, but really focused around 3 main points:

1. Management is about output
2. A manager’s output is the output of org under and the adjacent org
3. The team only does well when peak performance is elicited from each member of the team

__Output__

The most important thing about management is that it’s all about output. You are building a machine - a black box in which you put something in, and something else comes out. To build and then optimize this, there are 3 important pieces — planning, production/indicators, and improving.

*Planning*

Planning is about achieving a consistent outcome in a stable and timely way. To do this, you always have to start with your limiting factor. That is the element of the plan that the rest of the plan must follow. 

Example - If you’re trying to make a quality breakfast plate quickly (egg, toast, bacon), the limiting factor is what will take the longest to cook (the egg). So you work out how to boil the egg and then work backwards from there to get the rest of the plan in line. 

A note on plans — the plan itself is often useless, but the act of planning is useful. Plans need to be made like that of a firefighter — you’re not sure what/when/where, but you need to have a framework in place so that everyone knows how to respond in the case that there is a fire. That’s the type of plan to build.

*Production & Indicators*

After planning, you move onto production. Production is process, assembly, and testing. 

To monitor production and ensure success, you need to have the tools in place both to measure progress as well as outcome. Not only to evaluate how you did, but also to then figure out how to improve. 

There are 2 types of indicators to think through —

1. Leading
2. Trend

Production is again, like a black box. You put something in and something comes out. Leading indicators are like cutting small holes into your black box at certain steps to peer inside. You can then evaluate how things are going during production and if things are on track.

Trend indicators measure output against time. These should be compared both individually and globally to measure your output over time.

Remember that indicators are measures of output, not output itself. It’s easy to fall in love and over optimize for indicators instead of focusing on output. Don’t confuse motion with progress. To combat optimizing for indicators and/or motion, make sure to pair each of these indicators with something else that may be affected so you can measure the result and weight how it ultimately affects output.

*Improving*

As you move through production and you begin to measure each of these with different indicators, you will begin to think through how to optimize / improve these steps. There are 2 ways to improve things:

1. Do it faster
2. Do it differently

To do it faster, write out the steps and figure out how to reduce them. Automation is a good way. 

To do it differently, you have to fundamentally change how you do things, i.e. from a 100% audit process to an exception based audit. Either work, it depends on the context. 

Additionally, as production scales, the question then becomes around which parts of the machine do you continue to localize and which ones become centralized. You have to balance local (responsiveness) and centralized (scale). 

__People__

To achieve anything, the manager is relying on the team. Therefore the manager’s only job is to elicit peak performance from the team. 

There are 2 ways - training and motivation. Training is straightforward and there’s no magic to it, it just takes time and must be performed by the manager. As for motivation, there are 2 types — achievement and competence. Achievement is awards based (trophies, money, etc) and competence (i.e. violin player who practices all day to improve his craft). You have to tailor your leadership to respective types of motivation.

Steps to make sure you’re helping the team perform —

1. Making sure you’re continually adding value
2. Determine the TRM for your report
3. Set and communicate your modes of control
4. Make sure you’re spending your time on high leverage activities
5. Review indicators/output
6. Collect info & make decisions with the team.

*Adding Value*

Much of this is about managing other people. But first when managing yourself, always keep in mind — 

1. Are you adding value or just passing it along in the chain?
2. Are you plugged into what’s happening, both inside and outside the company?
3. Are you trying new things / ideas?

*Task Relevant Maturity*

TRM is an assessment of how capable someone is at doing that particular task. Higher means they’re more experienced, lower means less so. Your management style should depend not by person, but by their TRM for that particular task (it can be different for the same person across different tasks).

If their TRM is low, you need to have a structured program in place - what, when, how, etc. If it’s high, setting high level objectives/goals and reviews will suffice. And there are several shades of gray in the middle.

*Modes of control*

There are 3 modes of control when it comes to dealing with your team —

1. Free Market Forces
2. Contractual Obligations
3. Values

Free market is when there is no management needed and the market sets the rules. Buying something at the flea market is an example of free market forces. All you can do is abide by the what is set. 

Contractual obligations are when the transaction cost rises and so for consistency, there is an agreement in place. Hiring is an example - whoever is hired will do X job, and in turn, they will get paid for it. To manage this, you need review and policing functions to ensure that terms of contract are being met and held. 

And values are when the context changes faster than decisions can be made. And so values in turn encapsulate a framework to make decisions. The only way to enforce these is to live them as an example. 

Determine what is which, and communicate this over. What are the values and how to embody those, how will someone be evaluated for contractual obligations, etc. 

*Managerial Leverage*

Manager’s output = output of his org + output of neighboring org that they influence.

You can be doing any number of things at one time. But to make sure you are getting the most out of your team, you have to make sure you are sending your time on high leverage activities. A few steps — 

1. Figure out limiting step
2. Batch similar tasks
3. Take control of your calendar - plan out time to do things
4. Say no earlier (more expensive to say no after has gone through some production)
5. Allow slack - don’t have a single unexpected event derail your whole day

There’s also negative leverage — meddling when you don’t know what you’re doing. Don’t be one of these managers. 

*Collecting Info and Making Decisions*

Ultimately, managers have 2 actions — collect info, and make decisions. Unfortunately, meetings are the best way to do this. Doesn’t mean they have to suck, there are good meetings. We have just been exposed to so many bad meetings that they now carry a bad name. But good meetings do exist.

To classify, there are 2 types of meetings —

1. Process
2. Mission

Process meetings are regular updates and should be done with a production mindset — batch stuff together, review indicators, focus on outcomes, make decisions, etc. 3 types of these — 

1. 1-1
* The agenda should be set from the report
* How you manage them should be based on their TRM
* Get status updates around key indicators 
* How they’re feeling in general
* Listen to problems and things that will become problems

2. Staff Meeting
* Manager should set the agenda far before so team can review
* The team should be actively discussing, manager just supervising (focus on indicators/outputs, guide to decisions, etc)
* Only discuss things that affect more than 2 people

3. Operation Review
* Similar to staff meeting, but a full meeting across various departments
* Each team should be presenting, and the manager should be moderating

Mission oriented meetings are centered around a particular topic and solving a problem. In order for this to be effective, someone needs to own it — makes sure the right people are there, organize agenda ahead of time, keep people focused, and get the results out to everyone after. 

The output of meetings is 6 things:

1. What decision
2. When
3. Who will decide
4. Who to consult
5. Who to get approval from
6. Who to inform

Overall, a great read on people management and highly recommended. Again, tried to keep it short and group common things together. Let me know any thoughts / things I’m missing in the comments.
